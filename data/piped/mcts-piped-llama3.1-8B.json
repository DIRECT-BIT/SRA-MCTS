We start by initializing a variable `steps` to store the number of steps and set it to 0.\n2.  We convert the binary string `s` to an integer using the built-in `int` function with base 2.\n3.  We then enter a while loop that continues until the current number `num` is not equal to 1.\n4.  Inside the loop, we check if the current number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is even, we divide the number by 2 using the floor division operator (`//=`).\n5.  If the current number is odd, we add 1 to it.\n6.  We increment the `steps` variable by 1 after each operation.\n7.  Once the loop exits, we return the total number of steps.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n```python\nprint(numSteps(\"111\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(numSteps(\"10\"))   # Output: 4\nprint(numSteps(\"7\"))    # Output: 4\n```"}

This function should take the ring string, the character to rotate to, and the current character as input, and return the minimum distance between the two characters when rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise. The function can be implemented using string manipulation and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\nStep 2: Implement a function to calculate the distance between the current character and the target character for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations.  This function can be achieved by extending the existing function to consider both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations. We can use the same string manipulation and modular arithmetic techniques to calculate the distances for both rotations.  For example, if we have a ring string \"godding\" and we want to rotate it to align the character \"d\" with the current character \"g\", we can calculate the distance for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations using the following formulas:  - Clockwise rotation: `distance_clockwise = (ring.index(target_char) - ring.index(current_char)) % ring.length` - Anticlockwise rotation: `distance_anticlockwise = (ring.index(current_char) - ring.index(target_char)) % ring.length`  We can then use these distances to determine the minimum number of steps required to spell each character in the key.  The next step will be to use this function to iterate over each character in the key and calculate the minimum number of steps required to spell it.\nHere is the Python solution that follows the analysis steps:\n\n```python\ndef rotateString(ring, key):\n    def distance(ring, target_char, current_char):\n        target_index = ring.index(target_char)\n        current_index = ring.index(current_char)\n        clockwise = (target_index - current_index) % len(ring)\n        anticlockwise = (current_index - target_index) % len(ring)\n        return min(clockwise, anticlockwise)\n\n    steps = 0\n    current_char = ring[0]\n    for char in key:\n        if char == current_char:\n            steps += 1\n            current_char = ring[(ring.index(current_char) + 1) % len(ring)]\n        else:\n            steps += min(distance(ring, char, current_char) + 1, len(ring) - distance(ring, char, current_char) + 1)\n            current_char = char\n    return steps\n\n# Test cases\nprint(rotateString(\"godding\", \"gd\"))  # Output: 4\nprint(rotateString(\"godding\", \"godding\"))  # Output: 13\n```\n\nThis solution works by first defining a helper function `distance` to calculate the minimum distance between two characters in the ring for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations. The main function `rotateString` then iterates over each character in the key, calculating the minimum number of steps required to spell it by considering both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations.

However, we need to find the nth digit of this sequence. To approach this, we can first calculate the nth number in the sequence and then find the nth digit of that number.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the nth Number in the Sequence\nSince the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is `a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d`, where `a_n` is the nth term, `a_1` is the first term, `n` is the term number, and `d` is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, `a_1 = 1` and `d = 1`, so the formula simplifies to `a_n = n`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the nth Digit of the Number\nTo find the nth digit of the number, we can convert the number to a string and then access the nth character of the string.\n\n### Step 4: Handling Large Numbers\nSince the numbers in the sequence can be very large, we need to handle them carefully to avoid integer overflow. We can use a string to store the number and then access the nth character of the string.\n\n### Step 5: Implementing the Solution in Python\n```python\ndef find_nth_digit(n):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    num_str = str(n)\n    \n    # Find the length of the number\n    num_len = len(num_str)\n    \n    # If the nth digit is within the first num_len digits, return the nth digit\n    if n <= num_len:\n        return int(num_str[n - 1])\n    \n    # If the nth digit is beyond the first num_len digits, find the number that contains the nth digit\n    else:\n        # Calculate the number that contains the nth digit\n        num = 10 ** (n - num_len - 1) * (n - num_len)\n        \n        # Convert the number to a string\n        num_str = str(num)\n        \n        # Return the nth digit\n        return int(num_str[-1])\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n```python\nprint(find_nth_digit(1))  # Output: 1\nprint(find_nth_digit(2))  # Output: 2\nprint(find_nth_digit(3))  #"}

Otherwise, you move to `next`.\n*   The game ends when you reach the square `n2`.\n\nA board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n2` do not have a snake or ladder.\n\nNote that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent snake or ladder.\n\n*   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do **not** follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.\n\nReturn _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n2`_.

If they are not, it adds an edge between them by updating the parent map. If they are in the same set, it means there's a cycle, and the function returns the current edge.\n*   The `find_parent` function is a helper function that finds the parent of a node in the union-find data structure using path compression.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nedges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]\nprint(solution.findRedundantConnection(edges))  # Output: [2, 3]\n```\n\nIn this example, the graph starts as a tree with nodes 1, 2, and 3.

This method should visit the nodes in ascending order and append their values to the string, separated by a delimiter (e.g., commas or spaces).\nStep 2: Design the deserialization method using a recursive approach, which will take the serialized string as input, split it into individual node values, and reconstruct the binary search tree by recursively creating new nodes and updating the left and right child pointers.\n\nHere's a Python solution that implements the serialization and deserialization of a binary search tree based on the provided steps:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"Represents a node in a binary search tree.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\n\nclass Codec:\n\n    def serialize(self, root):\n        \"\"\"Encodes a tree to a single string.\n        \n        :type root: TreeNode\n        :rtype: str\n        \"\"\"\n        def inorder_traversal(node):\n            \"\"\"In-order traversal of the binary search tree.\"\"\"\n            if not node:\n                return 'X,'\n            return inorder_traversal(node.left) + str(node.val) + ',' + inorder_traversal(node.right)\n\n        return inorder_traversal(root)\n\n\n    def deserialize(self, data):\n        \"\"\"Decodes your encoded data to tree.\n        \n        :type data: str\n        :rtype: TreeNode\n        \"\"\"\n        nodes = data.split(',')\n        self.index = 0\n\n        def recursive_deserialize():\n            \"\"\"Recursive function to reconstruct the binary search tree.\"\"\"\n            if self.index >= len(nodes) or nodes[self.index] == 'X':\n                self.index += 1\n                return None\n            node = TreeNode(int(nodes[self.index]))\n            self.index += 1\n            node.left = recursive_deserialize()\n            node.right = recursive_deserialize()\n            return node\n\n        return recursive_deserialize()\n\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample binary search tree:\n    #       1\n    #      / \\\n    #     2   3\n    #    / \\   \\\n    #   4   5   6\n\n    root = TreeNode(1)\n    root.left = TreeNode(2)\n    root.right = TreeNode(3)\n    root.left.left = TreeNode(4)\n    root.left.right = TreeNode(5)\n    root.right.right = TreeNode(6)\n\n    codec = Codec()\n    serialized_tree = codec.serialize(root)\n    print(\"Serialized tree:\", serialized_tree)\n\n    deserialized_root = codec.deserialize(serialized_tree)\n    # You can print the deserialized tree here or use it as needed.\n```\n\nThis solution defines a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in the binary search tree and a `Codec` class with `serialize` and `deserialize` methods.

This can be achieved by treating each index in the array as a bit, where a 1 indicates that the element at that index is included in the subsequence and a 0 indicates that it is not.

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n*   (An integer could be positive or negative.)\n*   A let expression takes the form `\"(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr) \"`, where let is always the string `\"let \"`, then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression `expr`.\n*   An add expression takes the form `\"(add e1 e2) \"` where add is always the string `\"add \"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.\n*   A mult expression takes the form `\"(mult e1 e2) \"` where mult is always the string `\"mult \"`, there are always two expressions `e1`, `e2` and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n*   For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names `\"add \"`, `\"let \"`, and `\"mult \"` are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n*   Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** expression =  \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y)))) \"\n**Output:** 14\n**Explanation:** In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** expression =  \"(let x 3 x 2 x) \"\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n**Input:** expression =  \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y)) \"\n**Output:** 5\n**Explanation:** The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= expression.length <= 2000`\n*   There are no leading or trailing spaces in `expression`.\n*   All tokens are separated by a single space in `expression`.\n*   The answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.\n*   The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.", "solution": "Step 1: Parse the input expression into a list of tokens by splitting it at the spaces and then define a recursive function to handle the let expressions, which will evaluate the expressions in the let statement from left to right and then evaluate the final expression. This function should take into account the scope of the let expression and evaluate the variable assignments sequentially.\nStep 2: Define the recursive function to evaluate the let expressions by iterating over the variable assignments in the let statement and evaluating the final expression with the assigned values.  To do this, we need to create a dictionary to store the variable assignments, and then iterate over the variable assignments in the let statement. For each assignment, we need to evaluate the expression and update the dictionary with the assigned value. After all assignments have been made, we can evaluate the final expression with the assigned values.   We should also consider the scope of the let expression by checking if a variable has already been assigned a value in the current scope, and if so, use that value instead of evaluating the expression.\nHere is the code that follows the given analysis steps:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate(expression):\n    def parse_expression(expression):\n        tokens = expression.split()\n        if len(tokens) == 1:\n            return int(tokens[0])\n        token = tokens[0]\n        if token == 'let':\n            vars = {}\n            i = 1\n            while i < len(tokens):\n                var = tokens[i]\n                i += 1\n                expr = parse_expression(' '.join(tokens[i:i+2]))\n                i += 2\n                if var in vars:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Variable already assigned\")\n                vars[var] = expr\n            expr =''.join(tokens[i:])\n            return evaluate(expr, vars)\n        elif token == 'add':\n            return parse_expression(' '.join(tokens[1:3])) + parse_expression(' '.join(tokens[3:]))\n        elif token =='mult':\n            return parse_expression(' '.join(tokens[1:3])) * parse_expression(' '.join(tokens[3:]))\n        else:\n            return int(token)\n\n    def evaluate(expr, vars={}):\n        if expr.isdigit():\n            return int(expr)\n        elif expr.startswith('let'):\n            return parse_expression(expr)\n        else:\n            tokens = expr.split()\n            if tokens[0] in vars:\n                return vars[tokens[0]]\n            else:\n                return parse_expression(expr)\n\n    return evaluate(expression)\n\n# Test the function\nprint(evaluate(\"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y)))) \"))  # Output: 14\nprint(evaluate(\"(let x 3 x 2 x) \"))  # Output: 2\nprint(evaluate(\"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y)) \"))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis code first defines a helper function `parse_expression` to parse the input expression into a list of tokens and then recursively evaluate the expression. The `evaluate` function is a wrapper around `parse_expression` that handles the let expressions and their scope. The `evaluate` function takes an optional dictionary of variables as a parameter to handle the scope of the let expression. If a variable has already been assigned a value in the current scope, it uses that value instead of evaluating the expression."}

For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, if the current cell is `1`, we update `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of the top, left, and top-left cell plus 1.

This algorithm is well-suited for this problem because it only needs to scan the array once and can modify the elements in-place.\n\n### Dutch National Flag Algorithm Implementation\n\n```python\ndef sort_colors(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (representing red, white, and blue) in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        nums (list): A list of integers representing the colors of the objects.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize pointers for the three colors\n    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1\n\n    # Continue iterating until the mid pointer crosses the high pointer\n    while mid <= high:\n        # If the current element is 0, swap it with the element at the low pointer and move both low and mid pointers forward\n        if nums[mid] == 0:\n            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]\n            low += 1\n            mid += 1\n        # If the current element is 1, just move the mid pointer forward\n        elif nums[mid] == 1:\n            mid += 1\n        # If the current element is 2, swap it with the element at the high pointer and move the high pointer backward\n        else:\n            nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]\n            high -= 1\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\nsort_colors(nums)\nprint(nums)  # Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n```\n\nThis code implements the Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort the array in-place. It uses three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`, which represent the positions where the next 0, 1, and 2 should be placed, respectively. The algorithm iterates through the array, swapping elements as necessary to maintain the correct order. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and the space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers."}

If `MountainArray.get(mid)` is greater than `MountainArray.get(mid + 1)`, the peak is on the left half, so update `right` to `mid`. Otherwise, the peak is on the right half, so update `left` to `mid + 1`. Repeat this process until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.\nHere's the code based on the given problem and step-by-step analysis:\n\n```python\nclass MountainArray:\n\n    def get(self, k):\n        # This method should be implemented in the MountainArray class\n        # It should return the element at index k\n        pass\n\n    def length(self):\n        # This method should be implemented in the MountainArray class\n        # It should return the length of the array\n        pass\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findPeak(self, mountain_arr, target):\n        left, right = 0, mountain_arr.length() - 1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if mountain_arr.get(mid) == target:\n                return mid\n            elif mountain_arr.get(mid) < target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nmountain_arr = MountainArray()\n# Initialize mountain_arr here\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.findPeak(mountain_arr, target))\n```\n\nThis solution uses a binary search approach to find the target in the mountain array.

If the total sum is even, it's always possible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sums. If the total sum is odd, we need to proceed with further analysis to check if it's possible to find a subset with a sum of 1 less than the total sum.\nHere is a Python solution that follows the given steps:\n\n```python\ndef splitArraySameAverage(nums):\n    def is_subset_sum(nums, target, i, path):\n        if path:\n            if sum(path) == target:\n                return True\n            if sum(path) > target or i == len(nums):\n                return False\n        for j in range(i, len(nums)):\n            if is_subset_sum(nums, target, j + 1, path + [nums[j]]):\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    total_sum = sum(nums)\n    if total_sum % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        for i in range(1, total_sum // 2):\n            if is_subset_sum(nums, total_sum - i, 0, []):\n                return True\n        return False\n```\n\nThis solution uses a helper function `is_subset_sum` to check if there is a subset with a sum equal to a given target. The main function `splitArraySameAverage` calculates the total sum of the array and checks if it's even or odd. If the total sum is even, it returns `True` immediately. If the total sum is odd, it tries to find a subset with a sum of 1 less than the total sum using the `is_subset_sum` function. If such a subset is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n * 2^n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`."}

We will define a recursive function `numDistinct` that takes two parameters: the current index `i` in string `s` and the current index `j` in string `t`. This function will calculate the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the current indices `i` and `j`.  We will also define a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `(len(s) + 1) x (len(t) + 1)` to store the intermediate results. The table `dp[i][j]` will store the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the current indices `i` and `j`.  The base cases for the recursion will be when `j` is equal to the length of string `t` (i.e., we have processed all characters in `t`), in which case we will return 1 (since there is only one way to form an empty string), or when `i` is greater than the length of string `s` (i.e., we have processed all characters in `s`), in which case we will return 0 (since there are no more characters to form the subsequence).  The recursive case will consider two possibilities: either we include the current character in `s` at index `i` in the subsequence, or we do not include it. If we include the current character, we will check if it matches the current character in `t` at index `j`. If it matches, we will add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences. If it does not match, we will simply add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences. If we do not include the current character, we will simply add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences.  The final answer will be stored in the cell `dp[len(s)][len(t)]` of the dynamic programming table.\nStep 2: Now we need to modify the recursive function to handle the case when the current character in `s` does not match the current character in `t` but the subsequence can still be formed by excluding the current character in `s`. We will add a condition to check if the current character in `t` is the same as the previous character in `t`, and if so, we will exclude the current character in `s` and add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j`. This can be done by adding a new condition to the recursive case: if `j > 0` and `t[j] == t[j - 1]`, we will add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j - 1` to the current number of distinct subsequences.\nHere is the complete code based on the given analysis:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:\n        m, n = len(s), len(t)\n        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n        \n        for j in range(n + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = 1\n        \n        for i in range(1, m + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]\n                elif j > 0 and t[j - 1] == t[j - 2]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]\n        \n        return dp[m][n]\n```\n\nThis code implements the dynamic programming approach described in the analysis.

This function should return a tuple containing the maximum path sum including the node and the maximum path sum excluding the node. The function should consider the maximum path sum of the left and right subtrees when calculating the maximum path sum including the node.   This step is crucial as it sets the foundation for the DFS approach and allows us to keep track of the maximum path sum including and excluding each node. The recursive function will be used to traverse the binary tree and calculate the maximum path sum.\nHere is the Python solution for the given problem:\n\n```python\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\nclass Solution:\n    def maxPathSum(self, root):\n        self.max_sum = float('-inf')\n        \n        def max_gain(node):\n            nonlocal self\n            if not node:\n                return 0\n            \n            # Recursively calculate the maximum gain for the left and right subtrees\n            left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)\n            right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)\n            \n            # Update the maximum path sum\n            self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, node.val + left_gain + right_gain)\n            \n            # Return the maximum gain including the current node\n            return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)\n        \n        max_gain(root)\n        return self.max_sum\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `maxPathSum` method is the main function that initializes the `max_sum` variable to negative infinity and calls the `max_gain` function to start the DFS traversal.\n*   The `max_gain` function is a recursive function that calculates the maximum gain for a given node. It returns the maximum gain including the current node.\n*   If the node is `None`, it returns 0 as there is no gain.\n*   It recursively calculates the maximum gain for the left and right subtrees and stores them in `left_gain` and `right_gain`.\n*   It updates the `max_sum` variable with the maximum path sum including the current node.\n*   Finally, it returns the maximum gain including the current node, which is the sum of the node's value and the maximum gain of its left and right subtrees.\n*   The `maxPathSum` method returns the `max_sum` variable, which holds the maximum path sum of any non-empty path in the binary tree.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, and a space complexity of O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive call stack."}

If the node has no right child, it moves up the tree to find the in-order successor by checking if the parent of the current node is its left child. The `findMin` function is a helper function that finds the smallest node in a given tree by traversing down the left subtree until it reaches a leaf node."}

The function returns the sum of the root-to-leaf numbers in the subtree rooted at the current node.\n\nThe base case is when the current node is `None`, in which case the function returns 0, indicating that there is no contribution to the total sum from this subtree.\n\nIf the current node is a leaf node and it's on the left, the function returns its value, which is the sum of the root-to-leaf path.\n\nOtherwise, the function recursively traverses the left and right child nodes by calling itself with the child node and `True` or `False` as the second argument, depending on whether the child node is a left child. The results from these recursive calls are added together to obtain the total sum of the root-to-leaf numbers in the subtree rooted at the current node.\n\nThe `sumOfLeftLeaves` function is the main function that calls the `dfs` function on the root node and returns the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```python\n# Create a binary tree:\n#       1\n#      / \\\n#     2   3\n#    /\n#   4\n\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\n\nsolution"}

This means that the total number of \"G \" instructions should be equal to the total number of \"L \" and \"R \" instructions combined.\n\n### Step 5: Write the code to check if the robot will stay within a circle.\n\nHere is the Python code to check if the robot will stay within a circle:\n\n```python\ndef isRobotInCircle(instructions: str) -> bool:\n    # Initialize the count of G, L, and R instructions\n    count_g = 0\n    count_l = 0\n    count_r = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each instruction\n    for instruction in instructions:\n        if instruction == 'G ':\n            count_g += 1\n        elif instruction == 'L ':\n            count_l += 1\n        elif instruction == 'R ':\n            count_r += 1\n\n    # Check if the total number of G instructions is equal to the total number of L and R instructions combined\n    return count_g == count_l + count_r\n```\n\nHowever, this code does not check if the robot will stay within a circle. It only checks if the robot will repeat its path. To check if the robot will stay within a circle, we need to calculate the net displacement in the x and y directions.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the net displacement in the x and y directions.\n\nLet's consider the instructions given to the robot"}

We will use a loop to iterate over the nodes in the tree and call the `dfs` function to calculate the smallest missing genetic value for each node.\n\n```python\ndef smallestMissingValueSubtree(n, parents, nums):\n    # Initialize the result array with infinity to represent unknown smallest missing genetic values\n    ans = [math.inf] * n\n    \n    # Call the dfs function to calculate the smallest missing genetic value for each node\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i!= 0:\n            ans[i] = dfs(i, parents, nums, set())\n    \n    return ans\n```\n\nStep 4: \nWe need to call the `smallestMissingValueSubtree` function to get the final result.\n\n```python\nn = 4\nparents = [-1, 0, 0, 2]\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nresult = smallestMissingValueSubtree(n, parents, nums)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef dfs(i, parents, nums, seen):\n    # Create a"}

It uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to narrow down the possible celebrity. If `i` knows `j`, we move `j` forward, and if `j` does not know `i`, we move `i` forward. This process continues until `j` reaches the end of the list. At this point, `i` is the potential celebrity.\n\nWe then verify if `i` is indeed the celebrity by checking if all other people know `i` and `i` does not know any of them. If `i` is the celebrity, we return `i`. Otherwise, we return -1.\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of people at the party. This is because we make a single pass through the list to find the potential celebrity, and then make another pass to verify if the potential celebrity is indeed the celebrity. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers `i` and `j`."}

It starts by calculating the range of cities that can be powered by each existing power station. Then, for each city, it uses a BFS to find the maximum possible minimum power it can be provided with, considering the additional power stations that can be built within its range.

If the count is odd, it means there is an odd number of '+' characters, and the starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the last '+' character to '-' and then flipping all other pairs of '+' characters to '--'. If the count is even, it means there is an even number of '+' characters, and the starting player cannot guarantee a win because they will be left with an even number of '+' characters at the end of the game, which is a losing state.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `currentState` string, because the `count` method of Python strings counts the occurrences of a substring in linear time.

The main idea is to decide which half of the search space to search further based on the middle element of the current search space.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the conditions for deciding which half of the search space to search further\n\nWe will compare the middle element of the current search space with the first element of the array. There are three possible cases:\n\n1.  If the middle element is greater than the first element, the minimum element must be in the right half of the search space. This is because the array is sorted, so if the middle element is greater than the first element, the right half must be greater than the left half.\n2.  If the middle element is less than the first element, the minimum element must be in the left half of the search space. This is because the array is rotated, so if the middle element is less than the first element, the left half must be the rotated part of the array, and the minimum element must be in the left half.\n3.

We initialize a queue with the positions of the gates and mark them as visited by setting their value to 1.\n5.  We perform BFS by exploring the neighbors of each room in the queue and updating their distances accordingly.\n6.

The `defaultdict` from the `collections` module is used to create an adjacency list representation of the friendship graph. The `deque` from the `collections` module is used to implement the queue for BFS.\n\nThe solution first initializes the queue with the starting person and level 0, then iteratively explores the graph level by level.

By sorting the array, we can efficiently iterate through all possible subsequences and calculate their widths.\nHere is the code that implements the solution based on the given problem and step-by-step analysis:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sumOfSubsequenceWidths(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(nums)\n        nums.sort()\n        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix[i + 1] = (prefix[i] + nums[i]) % MOD\n        \n        sum_of_widths = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            count_left = n - i - 1\n            count_right = i + 1\n            width = (prefix[count_left] - prefix[i]) * count_right + (prefix[n] - prefix[count_right]) * count_left\n            sum_of_widths = (sum_of_widths + width) % MOD\n        \n        return sum_of_widths\n```\n\nThis code first sorts the array in ascending order, then calculates the prefix sum array. It then iterates through the array, for each element, it calculates the width of all subsequences that end at the current element and start at the left of the current element, and all subsequences that start at the right of the current element and end at the current element. The sum of these widths is then added to the total sum. The result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow."}

The `dfs` function takes three parameters: `node`, `level`, and `max_level`. The `node` parameter is the current node being visited, `level` is the current level of the node, and `max_level` is the maximum level reached so far.\n\nThe function returns a list of values of the nodes at the current level. If the node is `None`, it returns an empty list. If this is the first node at the current level, it updates `max_level` and returns a list containing the value of the node.\n\nThe function recursively traverses the right subtree and the left subtree, and combines the results. The values of the nodes at the current level are returned by concatenating the results of the recursive calls.\n\nThe `rightSideView` function calls the `dfs` function with the root node and level 0, and returns the result.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```python\n# Create a binary tree\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot.left = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot.right.right = TreeNode(4)\n\n# Call the rightSideView function\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.rightSideView(root))  # Output: [1"}

This will help us group the strings and identify the largest possible group for each subset.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef numSpecialEquivGroups(words):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from the given list of words.\n\n    :param words: A list of strings of the same length\n    :return: The number of groups of special-equivalent strings\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a hash map to store the groups of special-equivalent strings\n    groups = {}\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Create a string of even and odd indexed characters\n        even_chars = \"\".join(sorted(word[::2]))\n        odd_chars = \"\".join(sorted(word[1::2]))\n\n        # Create a key for the hash map\n        key = even_chars + odd_chars\n\n        # Add the word to the corresponding group in the hash map\n        if key not in groups:\n            groups[key] = []\n        groups[key].append(word)\n\n    # Return the number of groups\n    return len(groups)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"zzxy\", \"xyzz\", \"x\", \"x\"]\nprint(numSpecialEquivGroups(words))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   The code defines a function `numSpecialEquivGroups` that takes a list of strings `words` as input.\n*   It creates a hash map `groups` to store the groups of special-equivalent strings.\n*   For each word in the list, it creates a string of even and odd indexed characters and uses it as a key in the hash map.\n*   If the key does not exist in the hash map, it creates a new list for the key and adds the word to it.\n*   Finally, it returns the number of keys in the hash map, which represents the number of groups of special-equivalent strings.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of the code is O(n*m*log(m)), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word. This is because for each word, we are sorting the characters at even and odd indices, which takes O(m*log(m)) time.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity of the code is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all words in the hash map."}

A suitable algorithm for this problem is the two-pointer technique, which involves using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the array and the other from the end, and moving them towards each other until the target is found. We can outline the overall logic as follows: one pointer will start from the beginning of the array (index 1), and the other pointer will start from the end of the array.

Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.\n\nIf `targetCapacity` liters of water are measurable, you must have `targetCapacity` liters of water contained **within one or both buckets** by the end.\n\nOperations allowed:\n\n*   Fill any of the jugs with water.\n*   Empty any of the jugs.\n*   Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the three initial states of the jugs: both jugs are empty, both jugs are filled, and one jug is filled while the other is empty.

Specifically, it finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two jug capacities and checks if the target capacity is a multiple of the GCD. If it is, then it's possible to measure the target capacity using the two jugs.\n\nThe code uses the built-in `math.gcd` function to calculate the GCD and the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the target capacity is a multiple of the GCD. The function returns `True` if the target capacity is measurable and `False` otherwise."}

{"question": "For the given problem, generate a step-by-step plan for solving it, followed by the corresponding Python code.\nGiven an array of **distinct** strings `words`, return _the minimal possible **abbreviations** for every word_.\n\nThe following are the rules for a string abbreviation:\n\n1.  The **initial** abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.\n2.  If more than one word shares the **same** abbreviation, then perform the following operation:\n    *   **Increase** the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by `1`.\n        *   For example, say you start with the words `[ \"abcdef \", \"abndef \"]` both initially abbreviated as `\"a4f \"`. Then, a sequence of operations would be `[ \"a4f \", \"a4f \"]` -> `[ \"ab3f \", \"ab3f \"]` -> `[ \"abc2f \", \"abn2f \"]`.\n    *   This operation is repeated until every abbreviation is **unique**.\n3.

This will help identify abbreviations that need to be modified by increasing the prefix.\nStep 2: Design a data structure, such as a Trie or a hash map, to store the abbreviations and their counts, and implement a mechanism to update the abbreviations in place, reducing the need for multiple iterations through the list.\nHere is the code that follows the provided steps:\n\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.count = 0\n        self.is_word = False\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words):\n        words.sort(key=len, reverse=True)\n        root = TrieNode()\n        result = []\n\n        for word in words:\n            node = root\n            for i in range(len(word) - 1, 0, -1):\n                if word[i] not in node.children:\n                    node.children[word[i]] = TrieNode()\n                node = node.children[word[i]]\n                node.count += 1\n            node.is_word = True\n\n        def dfs(node, prefix):\n            if node.is_word:\n                result.append(prefix)\n            for char, child in node.children.items():\n                dfs(child, prefix + char + str(child.count - 1))\n\n        dfs(root, \"\")\n        return result\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the provided code:\n\n1.  We start by creating a Trie data structure to store the words and their abbreviations. We use a TrieNode class to represent each node in the Trie, with a `children` dictionary to store child nodes and a `count` attribute to store the count of words passing through each node.\n2.  We sort the input words in descending order of their lengths to ensure that longer words are processed first. This is because we want to process longer words first to avoid reducing their abbreviations too early.\n3.  We create a Trie and iterate over the sorted words. For each word, we traverse the Trie from right to left (i.e., from the last character to the first), incrementing the count of each node we visit. We mark the final node as a word to indicate that it represents a complete word.\n4.  We define a helper function `dfs` to perform a depth-first search on the Trie. This function takes a node and a prefix as arguments and appends the prefix to the result list if the node represents a word. Then, it recursively calls itself for each child node, appending the character and the count of the child node to the prefix.\n5.  Finally, we call the `dfs` function on the root node with an empty prefix and return the result list, which contains the minimal possible abbreviations for each word.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N \\* M), where N is the number of words and M is the maximum length of"}

The program source is an array of strings `source` where `source[i]` is the `ith` line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `'\\n'`.\n\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\n*   The string `\"// \"` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n*   The string `\"/* \"` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `\"*/ \"` should be ignored.

To be clear, the string `\"/*/ \"` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\n*   For example, if the string `\"// \"` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n*   Similarly, if the string `\"/* \"` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\n*   For example, `source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */ \"; \"` will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `\"/* \"` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

{"question": "Think deeply about the problem to identify the best approach. Formulate a well-reasoned plan, explaining each step of the process in detail before generating the Python code to execute your solution.\nHere's the question:\nThere are three stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the positions of the stones.\n\nIn one move, you pick up a stone at an endpoint (i.e., either the lowest or highest position stone), and move it to an unoccupied position between those endpoints. Formally, let's say the stones are currently at positions `x`, `y`, and `z` with `x < y < z`. You pick up the stone at either position `x` or position `z`, and move that stone to an integer position `k`, with `x < k < z` and `k != y`.\n\nThe game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).\n\nReturn _an integer array_ `answer` _of length_ `2` _where_:\n\n*   `answer[0]` _is the minimum number of moves you can play, and_\n*   `answer[1]` _is the maximum number of moves you can play_.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Let's consider the cases where the stones are not in consecutive positions. To find the minimum number of moves, we need to determine the maximum number of moves required to arrange the stones in consecutive order. This can be achieved by analyzing the positions of the stones and finding the maximum number of moves needed to move the stones to the middle position.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef numMovesStones(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> List[int]:\n    # Sort the positions of the stones\n    a, b, c = sorted([a, b, c])\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum number of moves\n    min_moves = 0\n    if b - a > 1 and c - b > 1:\n        min_moves = 2\n    elif b - a > 1 or c - b > 1:\n        min_moves = 1\n\n    # Calculate the maximum number of moves\n    max_moves = (c - a - 2) - (b - a - 1)\n    \n    return [min_moves, max_moves]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe code implements the solution based on the given problem. The `numMovesStones` function takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, representing the positions of the stones.\n\n1.  **Sorting the positions**: First, the positions are sorted in ascending order to ensure that `a` is the smallest, `b` is the middle, and `c` is the largest position.\n2.  **Calculating the minimum number of moves**: The minimum number of moves is determined by checking if there are gaps between the stones. If there are gaps, the minimum number of moves is set to 2 (to move both stones to the middle position). If there is only one gap, the minimum number of moves is set to 1 (to move one stone to the middle position).\n3.  **Calculating the maximum number of moves**: The maximum number of moves is calculated by subtracting the number of moves required to move all stones to the middle position from the total number of gaps between the stones. This is done by subtracting 2 (the number of stones that need to be moved) from the total number of gaps between the stones (`c - a - 2`).\n4.  **Returning the result**: The function returns a list containing the minimum and maximum number of moves.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   `numMovesStones(1, 3, 5)` returns `[1, 2]`\n*   `numMovesStones(4, 3, 2)` returns `[0, 0]`\n*   `numMovesStones(3, 5, 1)` returns `[2, 3]`\n\nThis code provides"}

After that, write the Python code that executes the solution.\nYou are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation you can replace any element of the array with **any two** elements that **sum** to it.\n\n*   For example, consider `nums = [5,6,7]`. In one operation, we can replace `nums[1]` with `2` and `4` and convert `nums` to `[5,2,4,7]`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in **non-decreasing** order_.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Initialize variables to keep track of the number of operations and the current minimum operations. This can be done by setting two variables, `operations` and `min_operations`, to zero. The `operations` variable will be used to keep track of the total number of operations performed, and the `min_operations` variable will be used to store the minimum number of operations found so far.\nStep 2: Iterate through the array from the second element to the last, and for each element, check if it is greater than the previous element. If it is, calculate the difference between the current element and the previous element, and add the minimum number of operations required to replace the current element with a pair of elements that sum to it, to the `operations` variable.\nHere is the complete Python code that follows the given steps:\n\n```python\ndef minOperations(nums):\n    operations = 0\n    min_operations = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:\n            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]\n            operations += 1 + (diff - 1) // 2\n\n        min_operations = min(min_operations, operations)\n\n    return min_operations\n```\n\nHere is how the code works:\n\n1.  We initialize `operations` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of operations performed, and `min_operations` to infinity, which will store the minimum number of operations found so far.\n2.  We then iterate through the array from the second element to the last (i.e., from index 1 to the last index).\n3.  Inside the loop, we check if the current element (`nums[i]`) is greater than the previous element (`nums[i - 1]`). If it is, we calculate the difference between the current element and the previous element (`diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1`)].\n4.  We then add 1 plus the integer division of `diff - 1` by 2 to `operations`. The integer division `//` is used to get the number of pairs of elements that sum to the difference. For example, if `diff` is 5, `(diff - 1) // 2` would be 2, which means we need 2 pairs of elements (1 and 4, or 2 and 3) to sum to 5.\n5.  We then update `min_operations` with the minimum of its current value and `operations`, which effectively keeps track of the minimum number of operations found so far.\n6.  Finally, we return `min_operations`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(minOperations([5,6,7])  # Output: 1\nprint(minOperations([1,2,3,4,5])  # Output: 0\nprint(minOperations([1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10])  # Output: 2\n```"}

You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in random API.\n\nEach test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing.

Once the plan is ready, implement it in Python and generate the code.\nYou are given an undirected graph (the **\"original graph \"**) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

We will create a new graph data structure, possibly using an adjacency list or matrix, to represent the nodes and edges of the new graph.

We will need to keep track of the new nodes and edges created by subdividing each edge.\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def reachableNodes(self, edges, maxMoves, n):\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Build the new graph by subdividing each edge\n        for u, v, cnt in edges:\n            graph[u].append((v, cnt + 1))\n            graph[v].append((u, cnt + 1))\n        \n        # Perform BFS to find the reachable nodes\n        queue = deque([(0, 0)])\n        visited = set([0])\n        reachable_nodes = 0\n        \n        while queue:\n            node, moves = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # If the current node is reachable, add it to the count of reachable nodes\n            reachable_nodes += 1\n            \n            # Add the neighbors of the current node to the queue if they are reachable\n            for neighbor, edge_moves in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in visited and moves + edge_moves <= maxMoves:\n                    queue.append((neighbor, moves + edge_moves))\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n        \n        # Add the nodes that are reachable through the edges\n        for u, v, cnt in edges:\n            if u in visited and v in visited:\n                reachable_nodes += min(maxMoves, cnt)\n        \n        return reachable_nodes\n```\n\nThis solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the reachable nodes in the new graph. It starts by subdividing each edge in the original graph to create the new graph. Then, it performs BFS from node 0 to find all the reachable nodes within the given `maxMoves`. Finally, it adds the nodes that are reachable through the subdivided edges to the count of reachable nodes.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the original graph. The space complexity is also O(n + m) for storing the graph and the visited nodes."}

This delimiter should be a single character that is unlikely to occur in any of the strings themselves, such as a null character ('\\0') or a newline character ('\\n').\nStep 2: Develop a protocol to transmit the encoded string over the network, including techniques to handle potential transmission errors such as packet loss or corruption. This protocol should specify how the encoded string will be broken down into packets, how these packets will be transmitted, and how the receiver will reassemble the original encoded string from the received packets.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe will use the null character ('\\0') as the delimiter to separate each string in the list. The `encode` function will append each string to the encoded string, followed by the null character. The `decode` function will split the encoded string at the null character and return a list of strings.\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n\n// Machine 1 (sender)\nstd::string encode(const std::vector<std::string>& strs) {\n    std::string encoded_string;\n    for (const auto& str : strs) {\n        encoded_string += str + \"\\0\";\n    }\n    return encoded_string;\n}\n\n// Machine 2 (receiver)\nstd::vector<std::string> decode(const std::string& s) {\n    std::vector<std::string> strs;\n    size_t start = 0;\n    while (start < s.size()) {\n        size_t end = s.find(\"\\0\", start);\n        if (end == std::string::npos) {\n            break;\n        }\n        strs.push_back(s.substr(start, end - start));\n        start = end + 1;\n    }\n    return strs;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   In the `encode` function, we iterate over each string in the input vector `strs`. For each string, we append the string itself followed by the null character ('\\0') to the `encoded_string`.\n*   In the `decode` function, we use a while loop to find the null character in the encoded string. We start searching for the null character from the current `start` index. If we find the null character, we extract the substring between the current `start` index and the found null character index and add it to the `strs` vector. We then update the `start` index to the index after the null character. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the encoded string.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    std::vector<std::string> strs = {\"hello\", \"world\", \"foo\", \"bar\"};\n    std::string encoded_string = encode(strs);\n    std::cout << \"Encoded string: \" << encoded_string << std::endl;\n\n    std::vector<std::string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);\n    std::cout << \"Decoded strings: \";\n    for (const auto& str : strs2) {\n        std::cout << str << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n"}

For any given element, if it has k bits set, then there are (n - 2^k) elements that will produce a 0 when ANDed with it. This is because there are 2^k elements with k bits set, and we need to exclude the current element itself and the elements that have the same bits set. The key insight is to use this relationship to count the number of AND triples for each element, and then sum them up to get the total count.\nHere is the code that implements the given solution:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countTriplets(self, nums):\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            bits_set = 0\n            for j in range(32):\n                if (nums[i] >> j) & 1:\n                    bits_set += 1\n            count += (n - 2**bits_set) * (n - 2**bits_set) * (n - 2**bits_set)\n        return count\n```\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1.

This is because for any given element, there are (n - 2^k) elements that will produce a 0 when ANDed with it, where k is the number of bits set in the current element.\n3.

The function can be based on the property that two subtrees are flip equivalent if and only if their left and right subtrees are flip equivalent, or if one subtree is the flip of the other subtree.\n\n### Solution: \nHere's the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef flipEquiv(root1, root2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks if two binary trees are flip equivalent.\n\n    Args:\n    root1 (TreeNode): The root of the first binary tree.\n    root2 (TreeNode): The root of the second binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if the two trees are flip equivalent, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base case: If both trees are empty, they are flip equivalent.\n    if not root1 and not root2:\n        return True\n\n    # If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are not flip equivalent.\n    if not root1 or not root2:\n        return False\n\n    # If the values of the current nodes are different, the trees are not flip equivalent.\n    if root1.val!= root2.val:\n        return False\n\n    # Recursively check the left and right subtrees.\n    return (flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) and flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right)) or \\\n           (flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) and flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe `flipEquiv` function checks if two binary trees are flip equivalent by recursively comparing their subtrees. It checks if the current nodes have the same value, and then checks if the left and right subtrees are flip equivalent. If the left and right subtrees are flip equivalent, the function returns True. If the left and right subtrees are not flip equivalent, but one subtree is the flip of the other subtree, the function also returns True. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns False.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n```python\n# Create two binary trees\nroot1 = TreeNode(1)\nroot1.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot1.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot1.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot1.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot1.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot1.right.right = TreeNode(7)\n\nroot2 = TreeNode(1)\nroot2.left = TreeNode(3)\nroot2.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot2.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot2.left.right = TreeNode(5)\nroot2.right.left = TreeNode"}

The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.\n\nWhat if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?\n\nFor example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.\n\nGiven two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Initialize the maximum possible total to `desiredTotal` and the current total to `0`, and create a bitmask to represent the numbers that have been chosen by the first player, where each bit corresponds to a number from `1` to `maxChoosableInteger`.\nStep 2: Define a recursive function `can_force_win` that takes the current total, the bitmask representing the numbers chosen by the first player, and the maximum possible total as arguments. This function should attempt to reach the desired total by either adding a number from 1 to `maxChoosableInteger` to the current total (if the corresponding bit in the bitmask is not set) or switching to the second player and recursively calling `can_force_win` with the second player's possible moves.\n\nHere is the code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef canIWin(maxChoosableInteger: int, desiredTotal: int) -> bool:\n    max_total = desiredTotal\n    current_total = 0\n    mask = (1 << maxChoosableInteger) - 1\n\n    def can_force_win(current_total: int, bitmask: int, max_total: int) -> bool:\n        if current_total >= max_total:\n            return True\n        for i in range(maxChoosableInteger, 0, -1):\n            if (bitmask & (1 << (i - 1))) == 0:\n                if not can_force_win(current_total + i, bitmask - (1 << (i - 1)), max_total):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    return can_force_win(current_total, mask, max_total)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   We initialize the `max_total` to `desiredTotal` and the `current_total` to `0`. The `mask` is created using a bitwise shift operation to create a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a number from `1` to `maxChoosableInteger`.\n*   The `can_force_win` function takes the current total, the bitmask representing the numbers chosen by the first player, and the maximum possible total as arguments. It checks if the current total is greater than or equal to the maximum possible total. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the first player can force a win.\n*   If the current total is less than the maximum possible total, the function iterates over the numbers from `maxChoosableInteger` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order. For each number, it checks if the corresponding bit in the bitmask is not set. If it is not set, the function recursively calls `can_force_win` with the current total plus the number, the bitmask with the corresponding bit set to `1`, and the maximum possible total. If the recursive call returns `False`, it means the second player can prevent the first player from winning, so the function returns `True`, indicating that the first player can force a win.\n*   If the function iterates over all numbers and none of them allow the first player to force a win, it returns `False`, indicating that the first player cannot force a win.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n\n*   `canIWin(10, 100)` returns `True`\n*   `canIWin("}

It uses a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree, connecting each node to its next right node. The `connect` function modifies the binary tree in-place, updating the `next` pointers of the nodes. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1.  We start by checking if the root is `NULL`. If it is, we return immediately, as there's nothing to process.\n2.  We initialize a queue with the root node.\n3.  We enter a loop that continues until the queue is empty. This loop represents the level-order traversal of the tree.\n4.  Inside the loop, we get the size of the current level (i.e., the number of nodes at the current level).\n5.  We iterate through the nodes at the current level, processing each node by setting its `next` pointer to the next node in the current level (if it exists) and enqueuing its children (left child first, then right child).\n6.  Once we've processed all nodes at the current level, we move on to the next level by popping all nodes from the queue and adding their children to the queue.\n7.  We repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty, which indicates that we've processed all levels of the tree.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, since we visit each node once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we use a queue to store the nodes at each level."}

By sorting the strings, we can then proceed with grouping the adjacent strings.\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numSimilarGroups(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:\n        def isSimilar(X, Y):\n            # Check if two strings are similar\n            diff_count = 0\n            for i in range(len(X)):\n                if X[i]!= Y[i]:\n                    diff_count += 1\n                    if diff_count > 2:\n                        return False\n            return diff_count <= 2\n\n        strs.sort()\n        parent = {}\n        count = 0\n\n        for word in strs:\n            if word not in parent:\n                parent[word] = word\n                count += 1\n                for other_word in strs:\n                    if other_word!= word and isSimilar(word, other_word):\n                        parent[other_word] = word\n        return count\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first sort the list of strings in lexicographical order. Then we use the Union-Find algorithm to group the similar strings. The `isSimilar` function checks if two strings are similar by comparing the difference count between them. If the difference count is less than or equal to 2, it means the two strings are similar. \n\nWe use a dictionary `parent` to keep track of the parent of each string. Initially, each string is its own parent. When we find two similar strings, we union them by making the parent of the smaller string point to the larger string. The `count` variable keeps track of the number of groups.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of each string.

This set will be used to keep track of the x-coordinates where rectangles have ended, which will help us avoid counting overlapping areas multiple times.\nHere is the Python code that implements the given steps:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def totalArea(self, rectangles):\n        # Step 1: Sort the rectangles by their y2 coordinates in ascending order\n        rectangles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[3], x[2]))\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize a set to store the x-coordinates of the right edges of the rectangles that have been processed so far\n        right_edges = set()\n        \n        # Step 3: Initialize the total area\n        total_area = 0\n        \n        # Step 4: Process each rectangle from top to bottom\n        for rectangle in rectangles:\n            # Step 5: If the current rectangle's x1 coordinate is greater than the maximum x-coordinate of the right edges, \n            # it means that the current rectangle does not overlap with any previously processed rectangles, \n            # so we can simply add the area of the current rectangle to the total area\n            if rectangle[2] > max(right_edges):\n                total_area += rectangle[2] - rectangle[0] * (10**9 + 7)\n            \n            # Step 6: Add the x-coordinate of the right edge of the current rectangle to the set of right edges\n            right_edges.add(rectangle[2])\n            \n            # Step 7: Remove the x-coordinates of the right edges that are less than the x1 coordinate of the current rectangle \n            # from the set of right edges, because they are no longer valid\n            right_edges.difference_update({x for x in right_edges if x < rectangle[1]})\n        \n        return total_area % (10**9 + 7)\n```\n\nThis code implements the given steps to calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane, avoiding counting overlapping areas multiple times. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of rectangles. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the set of right edges."}

We can derive the following formulas based on the labelling pattern in odd and even rows:\n\n- For odd rows (r = 1, 3, 5,...), the labelling is left to right, so the position `p` is calculated as `p = (label - 2^(r-1)) / 2^(r-1)`.\n- For even rows (r = 2, 4, 6,...), the labelling is right to left, so the position `p` is calculated as `p = 2^r - (label - 2^(r-1)) / 2^(r-1)`.\n\nHowever, we need to adjust the formula to calculate the row number `r` and the node's position `p` directly from the label. We can simplify the formulas as follows:\n\n- For odd rows, `r = (log2(label - 1)) + 1` and `p = (label - 2^(r-1)) / 2^(r-1)`.\n- For even rows, `r = (log2(label)) + 1` and `p = 2^r - (label - 2^(r-1)) / 2^(r-1)`.\n\nHowever, the second formula for even rows is incorrect.

The `calculate_turn` function is a helper function that calculates the turn at a given point by finding the cross product of the vectors formed by the current point and the next two points. The main function iterates over all points in the polygon and checks if the turn at each point is counterclockwise. If it finds a point with a non-counterclockwise turn, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all points and hasn't returned `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the polygon is convex."}

The answer is returned as an array `[x, y]`.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Initialize the properties of the circle (radius and center coordinates) in the `Solution` class by defining the constructor `Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center)` and storing the input values in instance variables.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `Solution` class based on the provided steps:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class Solution {\n    private double radius;\n    private double x_center;\n    private double y_center;\n\n    public Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n        this.x_center = x_center;\n        this.y_center = y_center;\n    }\n\n    public double[] randPoint() {\n        // Generate a random angle between 0 and 2π\n        Random random = new Random();\n        double angle = 2 * Math.PI * random.nextDouble();\n\n        // Generate a random radius between 0 and the given radius\n        double r = radius * Math.sqrt(random.nextDouble());\n\n        // Calculate the x and y coordinates of the random point\n        double x = x_center + r * Math.cos(angle);\n        double y = y_center + r * Math.sin(angle);\n\n        return new double[] {x, y};\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Solution circle = new Solution(5.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n        double[] point = circle.randPoint();\n        System.out.println(\"Random point inside the circle: [\" + point[0] + \", \" + point[1] + \"]\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `Solution` class has a constructor that initializes the circle's properties. The `randPoint()` method generates a random point inside the circle by first generating a random angle and a random radius, then calculating the x and y coordinates of the point based on the circle's center and the generated angle and radius. The `main()` method demonstrates how to use the `Solution` class."}

If it's not empty, it dequeues the next element from the queue using `popleft()` and increments the index to point to the next element in the queue. If the queue is empty, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n3.  The `hasNext()` method checks if the index is less than the length of the queue.

The `backtrack` function is called recursively with different subsets, and the result is stored in the `result` list.

This approach will have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we are iterating through the array once and looking up each word in the hash map in constant time.\nHere is the Python code that implements the steps you provided:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def palindromePairs(self, words):\n        word_map = defaultdict(list)\n        for i, word in enumerate(words):\n            word_map[word[::-1]].append(i)\n\n        result = []\n        for i, word in enumerate(sorted(words)):\n            for k, v in word_map.items():\n                if word.startswith(k):\n                    for j in v:\n                        if j!= i:\n                            result.append([i, j])\n                            result.append([j, i])\n\n        return result\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   In the first step, we create a hash map `word_map` where the keys are the reverses of the words and the values are lists of indices of the words that have the corresponding reverse.\n*   We then iterate through the sorted array, and for each word, we check whether its reverse is in the hash map. If it is, we can add the pair of indices to the result list.\n*   We use the `startswith` method to check whether the current word starts with the reverse of another word, which allows us to efficiently find palindrome pairs.\n*   We also check whether the indices are not equal to avoid adding duplicate pairs to the result list.\n*   Finally, we return the list of palindrome pairs.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.palindromePairs([\"abcd\", \"dcba\", \"lls\", \"s\", \"sssll\"]))\n# Output: [[0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 2], [2, 4]]\n\nprint(solution.palindromePairs([\"bat\", \"tab\", \"cat\"]))\n# Output: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\nprint(solution.palindromePairs([\"a\", \"\"]))\n# Output: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps you provided and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we are iterating through the array once and looking up each word in the hash map in constant time."}

We can do this by setting `dp[i][j]` to `inf` (infinity) if the knight's health drops to `0` or below when moving from the room above or to the left. This is because it's not possible to reach the room at `(i, j)` if the knight's health drops to `0` or below.   For example, if `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` is less than or equal to `0`, we can set `dp[i][j]` to `inf`. This will ensure that we don't try to move to a room with a health of `0` or below, which would cause the knight's health to drop to `0` or below.\nStep 2: We need to calculate the minimum initial health required to reach each room in the first row and column. Since the knight can only move rightward or downward, the minimum initial health required to reach each room in the first row is the maximum of the health required to reach the previous room and the health in the current room. This can be calculated using the following logic: For the first row, we can calculate `dp[0][j]` as `max(dp[0][j-1], -dungeon[0][j])`, which means the minimum initial health required to reach the current room is the maximum of the minimum initial health required to reach the previous room and the negative health in the current room. This is because the knight can either move from the previous room to the current room or stay in the current room, and the minimum initial health required to reach the current room is the maximum of these two possibilities. Similarly, for the first column, we can calculate `dp[i][0]` as `max(dp[i-1][0], -dungeon[i][0])`. This logic can be applied to the first row and column of the dp table to initialize the values.\nHere's the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculateMinimumHP(self, dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        m, n = len(dungeon), len(dungeon[0])\n        dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]\n        \n        # Initialize the first row and column\n        dp[0][0] = max(-dungeon[0][0], 1)\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            dp[0][i] = max(dp[0][i-1], -dungeon[0][i])\n        \n        for i in range(1, m):\n            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], -dungeon[i][0])\n        \n        for i in range(1, m):\n            for j in range(1, n):\n                dp[i][j] = min(max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], -dungeon[i][j]), 1)\n        \n        return dp[m-1][n-1]\n```\n\nThis code first initializes a 2D table `dp` with all values set to infinity. It then initializes the first row and column of the table using the logic described in the steps. Finally, it fills in the rest of the table using the same logic, and returns the value in the bottom-right corner of the table, which represents the minimum initial health required to rescue the princess."}

It then iterates over the people array and uses the binary search function to find the first and last flowers that are in full bloom for each person's arrival time. The number of flowers that are in full bloom is calculated and stored in the answer array.\n\nThe binary search function is used to find the first or last flower that is in full bloom. It takes two parameters: the target time (the person's arrival time) and a boolean flag `is_first` to determine whether to find the first or last flower.

This will ensure that we explore all possible sequences of words from the beginWord to the endWord, and return all the shortest sequences.\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):\n    word_set = set(wordList)\n    if endWord not in word_set:\n        return []\n\n    queue = deque([[beginWord]])\n    visited = set([beginWord])\n    shortest = []\n\n    while queue:\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        word = path[-1]\n        if word == endWord:\n            shortest.append(path)\n        for i in range(len(word)):\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\n                if next_word in word_set and next_word not in visited:\n                    queue.append(path + [next_word])\n                    visited.add(next_word)\n\n    return shortest\n\nbeginWord = \"hit\"\nendWord = \"cog\"\nwordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]\nprint(findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `findLadders` that takes three inputs: `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList`. It first checks if `endWord` is in `wordList`. If not, it returns an empty list. Then it initializes a queue with a list containing `beginWord`, a set to keep track of visited words, and an empty list to store the shortest sequences. It enters a loop where it dequeues a word from the queue, checks if it is the `endWord`, and if so, adds it to the list of shortest sequences. It then generates all neighboring words of the current word, checks if they have not been visited before, and if so, marks them as visited and adds them to the queue. This process continues until the queue is empty, at which point it returns the list of shortest sequences.\n\nThe code uses a queue to store the words to be explored next, and a set to keep track of the words that have already been visited. It uses the `deque` data structure from the `collections` module to implement the queue, and the `set` data structure to keep track of visited words. The `findLadders` function returns a list of lists, where each sublist is a shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`.\n\nThis code should solve the problem efficiently by exploring all possible sequences of words from `beginWord` to `endWord` and returning all the shortest sequences."}

This can be approached using a greedy algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Approach\n\nBased on the problem's requirements, a greedy approach seems suitable because it aims to find a locally optimal solution at each step, which in this case is to move each 1 to the end of the array. This approach is more efficient than dynamic programming, which would require considering all possible permutations of the array.\n\n### Step 2: Outline the Greedy Approach\n\nThe greedy approach will work as follows:\n\n- Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.\n- Iterate through the array from left to right. When a 1 is encountered, swap it with the element at the end pointer.\n- Decrement the end pointer.\n- Continue this process until all 1's are at the end of the array.\n- The number of swaps made is the minimum number of swaps required.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Greedy Approach\n\nHere's the Python code to implement the greedy approach:\n\n```python\ndef minSwaps(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's together in any place in the array.\n    \n    Args:\n        data (list): A binary array containing 0's and 1's.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's together.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array\n    left = 0\n    right = len(data) - 1\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the number of swaps\n    swaps = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the array from left to right\n    for i in range(len(data)):\n        # If a 1 is encountered at the left pointer, swap it with the element at the end pointer\n        if data[left] == 1:\n            data[left], data[right] = data[right], data[left]\n            # Decrement the end pointer\n            right -= 1\n            # Increment the number of swaps\n            swaps += 1\n        # Move the left pointer to the right\n        left += 1\n    \n    # Return the minimum number of swaps required\n    return swaps\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0"}

To achieve this, we can iterate through both arrays, calculate the differences between consecutive elements in each array, and then compare these differences to identify the minimum number of swaps needed to eliminate the discrepancies between the two arrays.\nHere is a Python solution that implements the steps outlined above:\n\n```python\ndef minSwap(nums1, nums2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimum number of operations to make two integer arrays strictly increasing by swapping elements.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    nums1 (list): The first integer array.\n    nums2 (list): The second integer array.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The minimum number of operations needed to make both arrays strictly increasing.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Initialize variables to store the number of swaps for each array\n    swaps1 = 0\n    swaps2 = 0\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through both arrays to calculate the differences between consecutive elements\n    for i in range(1, len(nums1)):\n        # Calculate the differences between consecutive elements in nums1\n        if nums1[i] <= nums1[i-1]:\n            swaps1 += 1\n        # Calculate the differences between consecutive elements in nums2\n        if nums2[i] <= nums2[i-1]:\n            swaps2 += 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the minimum number of swaps needed to eliminate the discrepancies between the two arrays\n    # The minimum number of swaps is the minimum of the swaps needed for each array plus the number of elements that need to be swapped\n    return min(swaps1, swaps2) + min(min(i for i in range(len(nums1)) if nums1[i] > nums2[i]) or 0, min(i for i in range(len(nums1)) if nums2[i] > nums1[i]) or 0)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(minSwap([1,3,5,4], [1,2,3,7]))  # Output: 1\nprint(minSwap([0,3,5,8,9], [2,1,4,6,9]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined above and uses Python to implement the logic. It initializes variables to store the number of swaps for each array, iterates through both arrays to calculate the differences between consecutive elements, and determines the minimum number of swaps needed to eliminate the discrepancies between the two arrays. The solution includes example usage at the end to demonstrate its functionality."}

We want to represent `grid` with a Quad-Tree.\n\nReturn _the root of the Quad-Tree representing_ `grid`.\n\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\n*   `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.

We can use a variable named `secret_word` to hold the secret word, and we can also initialize an empty list to store the possible guesses.   We can start by sorting the list of words based on their similarity to the secret word. We can use a custom sorting function that calculates the similarity between two words based on the number of matching characters.\nStep 2: Implement a function to calculate the similarity between two words based on the number of matching characters. This function can be used to sort the list of words in descending order of similarity to the secret word.   The function can iterate over the characters of the two words and compare them. For each pair of characters, if they match, it increments a counter. The function then returns the counter as the similarity score. This score represents the number of matching characters between the two words.  For example, if we have two words \"acckzz\" and \"acckzz\", the similarity score would be 6, because all characters match. If we have two words \"acckzz\" and \"ccbazz\", the similarity score would be 3, because three characters match.

The key components involved are:\n\n*   A dynamic programming table to store the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at each index.\n*   A variable to track whether the array can be divided into disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least `k`.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize the dynamic programming table and variables\n\nWe will create a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. The table `dp[i]` will store the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n\nWe will also initialize a variable `flag` to track whether the array can be divided into disjoint increasing subsequences of length at least `k`.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the dynamic programming table\n\nWe will iterate over the array `nums` from left to right. For each element at index `i`, we will check if it is greater than the previous element. If it is, we will update `dp[i]` with `dp[i-1] + 1`. Otherwise, we will update `dp[i]` with 1.\n\n### Step 4: Check if the array can be divided into disjoint increasing subsequences\n\nWe will iterate over the dynamic programming table `dp` to check if any element is at least `k`. If we find such an element, we will set `flag` to `True`. If we do not find any such element, we will set `flag` to `False`.\n\n### Step 5: Return the result\n\nFinally, we will return the value of `flag`.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef can_divide_into_subsequences(nums, k):\n    n = len(nums)\n    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize dp table with 1s\n    flag = False  # Initialize flag to False\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:\n            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1  # Update dp[i] if nums[i] is greater than nums[i-1]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if dp[i] >= k:\n            flag = True  # Set flag to True if dp[i] is at least k\n\n    return flag  # Return the"}

The `helper` function is used to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from each node and its children. The base case is when the node is `None`, in which case the function returns 0. The maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the left and right subtrees are calculated recursively, and the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the current node is the sum of its value and the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from its left and right children. The function returns the maximum of the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the left and right children, and the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the current node."}

The first player colors the node with value `x` red, and the second player colors the node with value `y` blue.\n\nThen, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an **uncolored** neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)\n\nIf (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.\n\nYou are the second player.

We can identify a winning condition for the second player by analyzing the binary tree structure and the rules of the game.\n\nHere are the key observations:\n- The binary tree has `n` nodes with distinct values from `1` to `n`, where `n` is odd.\n- The first player chooses a node `x` and colors it red.\n- The second player chooses a node `y` (different from `x`) and colors it blue.\n- In each turn, a player chooses a node of their color and colors an uncolored neighbor (left child, right child, or parent).\n- If a player cannot choose such a node, they must pass their turn.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1.  **Determine the height of the tree**: Since `n` is odd, the tree must be a complete binary tree. The height of a complete binary tree with `n` nodes is `log2(n + 1)`.\n2.  **Identify the first player's choice**: The first player chooses a node `x` with value `1 <= x <= n`.

This is possible if the second player can color at least as many nodes as the first player in each level of the tree, except for the level where the first player chose their node `x`.\n5.  **Identify the nodes that can be colored by the second player**: In each level of the tree, the second player can color nodes that are not colored by the first player.

It then iterates over the string `s` from the second character to the end, updating the `dp` array accordingly. The number of ways to decode the substring ending at index `i` is the sum of the number of ways to decode the substring ending at `i - 1` and the number of ways to decode the substring ending at `i - 2`, considering the possible combinations of the current character and the previous two characters. The final result is returned as the value of `dp[n]`."}

{"question": "Create a structured approach to solve the problem, with each step explained in detail.

When a new character is added to the stream, append it to the character array and traverse the Trie from the root node. For each character in the character array, move to the corresponding node in the Trie. If a node is found for each character, it means a suffix of the stream matches a word in the Trie. Return `true` if such a suffix is found.\nHere is the Python code that implements the `StreamChecker` class based on the given steps:\n\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.is_end_of_word = False\n\nclass StreamChecker:\n    def __init__(self, words):\n        self.root = TrieNode()\n        self.chars = []\n        \n        # Populate the Trie by adding each word from the given array of strings\n        for word in words:\n            node = self.root\n            for char in word:\n                if char not in node.children:\n                    node.children[char] = TrieNode()\n                node = node.children[char]\n            node.is_end_of_word = True\n\n    def query(self, letter):\n        self.chars.append(letter)\n        \n        # Traverse the Trie from the root node\n        node = self.root\n        for char in reversed(self.chars):\n            if char not in node.children:\n                return False\n            node = node.children[char]\n            if node.is_end_of_word:\n                return True\n        return False\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n*   The `TrieNode` class represents a node in the Trie. Each node has a dictionary `children` to store its child nodes and a boolean flag `is_end_of_word` to indicate whether the node is the end of a word.\n*   The `StreamChecker` class has two main methods: `__init__` and `query`.\n*   In the `__init__` method, we populate the Trie by iterating through each word in the given array of strings. For each character in the word, we create a new node in the Trie if it doesn't exist and mark the node as the end of a word if it's the last character of the word.\n*   In the `query` method, we append the new character to the `chars` array and traverse the Trie from the root node. For each character in the `chars` array, we move to the corresponding node in the Trie. If a node is found for each character, it means a suffix of the stream matches a word in the Trie, so we return `True`. If any character in the `chars` array doesn't have a corresponding node in the Trie, we return `False`.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nwords = [\"abc\", \"xyz\"]\nstream_checker = StreamChecker(words)\nprint(stream_checker.query('a'))  # False\nprint(stream_checker.query('x'))  # False\nprint(stream_checker.query"}

This is because we have visited all the nodes in the left subtree of the current node, and now it's time to visit the current node.\n3.  **Check if the stack is empty**: If the stack is empty, it means we have visited all the nodes in the BST, and there are no more nodes to visit.

The `dfs` function takes three parameters: the current node, the remaining time, and the set of visited nodes. The base case is when we've exceeded the time limit or visited all nodes, in which case we return 0. The recursive case explores all possible edges from the current node, updates the memoization table, and prunes branches that exceed the time limit or have already been explored. The maximum quality of valid paths is stored in the memoization table and returned as the result."}

In the base case where there is only one balloon, the maximum coins that can be collected is the number on that balloon multiplied by 1, since there is no other balloon to burst.   Let's denote the array of balloon numbers as `nums` and the number of balloons as `n`. We can define the base case as follows:  - If `n == 1`, the maximum coins that can be collected is `nums[0] * 1`.  However, since we need to consider the coins that can be collected when there is no balloon left (i.e., when there is one balloon and we burst it), we also need to consider the case where `n == 0` or `n == -1` (to account for the balloons on the left and right of the first balloon).  - If `n == 0` or `n == -1`, the maximum coins that can be collected is 0, since there are no balloons to burst.  The base cases are essential to establish a recursive formula to calculate the maximum coins for a given number of balloons. In the next step, we can think about how to extend this formula to the case where there are multiple balloons.\nStep 2: Define the recursive formula for the 2D array dp. We can start by considering the case where there are two balloons, i.e., `j - i == 1`. In this case, the maximum coins that can be collected is the number on the left balloon multiplied by the number on the right balloon, plus the number on the right balloon multiplied by the number on the left balloon, since we can burst the left or right balloon first. However, since we need to consider the optimal order of bursting the balloons, we should also consider the case where `j - i > 1`. In this case, we can burst the balloon at index `k` (where `i <= k < j`) and get the coins `nums[i] * nums[k] * nums[j]`. The maximum coins that can be collected is then the maximum of the coins collected by bursting the left or right balloon first, plus the coins collected by bursting the balloon at index `k`. This recursive formula can be written as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][k] + nums[i] * nums[k] * nums[j], dp[k][j] + nums[i] * nums[k] * nums[j]) for `i <= k < j`.\nHere is the code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef maxCoins(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    nums = [1] + nums + [1]  # Add 1s to the left and right of the array\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize a 2D array to store the maximum coins\n\n    for length in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate over the length of the subarray\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length\n            for k in range(i, j):  # Burst the balloon at index k\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + nums[i - 1] * nums[k] * nums[j + 1])\n    return dp[0][n - 1]  # Return the maximum coins for the entire array\n\n# Test the function\nprint(maxCoins([3, 1, 5, 8]))  # Output: 167\nprint(maxCoins([1, 5]))  # Output: 10\n```\n\nIn this code, we first add 1s to the left and right of the array to handle the boundary cases. We then initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum coins that can be collected for each subarray. We iterate over the length of the subarray and for each subarray, we iterate over the possible positions where the balloon can be burst. We update the maximum coins for the subarray by considering the maximum coins that can be collected by bursting the balloon at each position. Finally, we return the maximum coins for the entire array."}

The function then recursively calls itself on the current node's left and right children, updates the current node's children based on the results of the recursive calls, and returns the updated node.

The `partition_score` function is a recursive function that takes the current array `nums`, the number of partitions `k`, the current index `i`, and the number of subarrays `num_subarrays` as parameters. The function returns the maximum score achievable by partitioning the array into `num_subarrays` subarrays with `k` allowed partitions.\n\nThe solution first calculates the prefix sum of the array `nums` and stores it in the `prefix_sum` list.

We need to iterate through each character in the password and check if it's a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. We'll keep track of the counts of these character types. This will allow us to assess the current state of the password and decide on the next steps to make it strong.\nStep 2: Identify the minimum steps required to address the issue of consecutive repeating characters. To do this, we need to consider the number of repeating character sequences in the password and the minimum number of steps required to break each sequence. We can achieve this by iterating through the password and keeping track of the current character and the count of consecutive occurrences. If the count exceeds 2, we increment the minimum steps by the count minus 2, as we need to replace the last two occurrences of the character to break the sequence.\nHere's the complete Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef strongPasswordChecker(password):\n    n = len(password)\n    missingType = 3\n    missingLower = sum(c.islower() for c in password)\n    missingUpper = sum(c.isupper() for c in password)\n    missingDigit = sum(c.isdigit() for c in password)\n\n    missing = missingType - (missingLower + missingUpper + missingDigit)\n    if missing > 0:\n        return max(missing, 6 - n)\n\n    # Initialize the counts of repeating characters\n    repeat = 0\n    last = ''\n    count = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i == 0 or password[i] == password[i - 1]:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            if count > 2:\n                repeat += count - 2\n            count = 1\n        last = password[i]\n\n    # Handle the last sequence\n    if count > 2:\n        repeat += count - 2\n\n    # Handle passwords with length less than 20\n    if n <= 20:\n        return max(0, 3 - repeat)\n\n    # Handle passwords with length greater than or equal to 20\n    delete = n - 20\n    return max(delete, repeat)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(strongPasswordChecker(\"a\"))  # Output: 5\nprint(strongPasswordChecker(\"aA1\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(strongPasswordChecker(\"1337C0d3\"))  # Output: 0\n```\n\nIn this code, we first determine the number of missing character types (lowercase, uppercase, digit) and calculate the minimum steps required to add these types. Then, we count the number of repeating character sequences in the password and calculate the minimum steps required to break these sequences. Finally, we calculate the minimum steps required to delete characters from the password if it has a length greater than 20. The maximum of these three values is the minimum steps required to make the password strong."}

Finally, we append `val` to the list of elements at its new frequency in `freq_stacks`.\nHere's the implementation of the `FreqStack` class based on the given problem and step-by-step analysis:\n\n```python\nclass FreqStack:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize your data structure here.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.freq_map = {}\n        self.freq_stacks = [[] for _ in range(1000)]  # We assume the maximum frequency is 1000\n        self.max_freq = 0\n\n    def push(self, val: int) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Push element val onto stack.\n        \"\"\"\n        if val not in self.freq_map:\n            self.freq_map[val] = 1\n        else:\n            self.freq_map[val] += 1\n        self.freq_stacks[self.freq_map[val]].append(val)\n        self.max_freq = max(self.max_freq, self.freq_map[val])\n\n    def pop(self) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns that element.\n        \"\"\"\n        val = self.freq_stacks[self.max_freq].pop()\n        self.freq_map[val] -= 1\n        if not self.freq_stacks[self.max_freq]:\n            self.max_freq -= 1\n        return val\n\n# Example usage:\nfreqStack = FreqStack()\nfreqStack.push(5)\nfreqStack.push(7)\nfreqStack.push(5)\nfreqStack.push(7)\nfreqStack.push(4)\nfreqStack.push(5)\nprint(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 5\nprint(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 7\nprint(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 5\nprint(freqStack.pop())  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis code implements the `FreqStack` class with the `push` and `pop` methods as described in the problem. The `push` method updates the frequency of the element in the `freq_map` and appends it to the list of elements at its new frequency in `freq_stacks`. The `pop` method removes the most frequent element from the top of the stack and updates the frequency of the remaining elements. The example usage demonstrates the usage of the `FreqStack` class with the given inputs."}

We'll create an empty hashmap `num_indices` to store the numbers as keys and their indices as values. We'll iterate over the array `nums` and for each number, we'll check if it's already in the hashmap. If it's not, we'll add it to the hashmap with its index as the value. If it is, we'll update its value in the hashmap to include the current index. This will allow us to efficiently look up the indices of numbers we've seen so far and check if there's a pair that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 2: Iterate over the hashmap and check each pair of numbers and their indices to see if they satisfy the given conditions. To do this, we'll create a nested loop structure, where the outer loop will iterate over the hashmap and the inner loop will also iterate over the hashmap. However, to avoid comparing a number with itself, we'll use a separate variable `num` to store the current number being processed in the outer loop and then iterate over the hashmap using a separate variable `num2` to store the current number being compared in the inner loop. This way, we can ensure that we're comparing each number with all other numbers in the hashmap, without comparing a number with itself.\nHere is the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, indexDiff, valueDiff):\n    num_indices = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        if i > indexDiff:\n            num_indices.pop(nums[i - indexDiff - 1])\n        bucket = num // (valueDiff + 1)\n        for k in [bucket - 1, bucket, bucket + 1]:\n            if k in num_indices and abs(num_indices[k] - i) <= indexDiff:\n                return True\n        num_indices[bucket] = i\n    return False\n```\n\nThis code first initializes an empty hashmap `num_indices` to store the numbers we've seen so far along with their indices. Then it iterates over the array `nums`. For each number, it checks if the number is outside the `indexDiff` window. If it is, it removes the number outside the window from the hashmap. It then calculates the bucket for the current number based on the `valueDiff`. It then checks all three buckets (the current bucket and the two adjacent buckets) in the hashmap to see if there's a pair of numbers that satisfy the given conditions. If it finds such a pair, it returns `True`. If it iterates over the entire array and doesn't find any such pair, it returns `False`.\n\nHere are the example use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate([1, 2, 3, 1], 3, 0))  # True\nprint(containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate([1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], 2, 3))  # False\n```\n\nThis code has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`, because it iterates over the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, it needs to store all numbers in the hashmap."}

You have to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts.\n\nFor each cut you choose the direction: vertical or horizontal, then you choose a cut position at the cell boundary and cut the pizza into two pieces. If you cut the pizza vertically, give the left part of the pizza to a person. If you cut the pizza horizontally, give the upper part of the pizza to a person.

The base cases will be when `i` or `j` is 0, in which case there is only one way to cut the pizza (no cuts).\nHere's the complete code in Python that implements the dynamic programming solution:\n```python\ndef ways(pizza: list[list[str]], k: int) -> int:\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    rows, cols = len(pizza), len(pizza[0])\n    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Base case: Initialize the first row and column\n    for j in range(cols):\n        if pizza[0][j] == 'A':\n            dp[0][j] = 1\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if pizza[i][0] == 'A':\n            dp[i][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            if pizza[i][j] == 'A':\n                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of ways to cut the pizza\n    total_ways = dp[rows-1][cols-1]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of ways to cut the pizza such that the last piece contains at least one apple\n    last_piece_ways = 0\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if pizza[i][j] == 'A':\n                last_piece_ways = (last_piece_ways + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n    \n    # Calculate the final answer\n    return (total_ways - last_piece_ways + MOD) % MOD\n```\nThis code implements the dynamic programming solution as described in the analysis. It first initializes the `dp` table with the base cases, then fills it up in a bottom-up manner. Finally, it calculates the total number of ways to cut the pizza and subtracts the number of ways where the last piece contains no apples to get the final answer. The answer is taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow."}

It keeps track of the longest duplicated substring and its length. If a duplicated substring with a longer length is found, it updates the longest duplicated substring.

{"question": "Create a structured approach to solve the problem, with each step explained in detail.

In each round, the `ith` player from the front of the row competes against the `ith` player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.\n\n*   For example, if the row consists of players `1, 2, 4, 6, 7`\n    *   Player `1` competes against player `7`.\n    *   Player `2` competes against player `6`.\n    *   Player `4` automatically advances to the next round.\n\nAfter each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the **original ordering** assigned to them initially (ascending order).\n\nThe players numbered `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are the best in the tournament.

A permutation of those `n` integers `perm` (**1-indexed**) is considered a **beautiful arrangement** if for every `i` (`1 <= i <= n`), **either** of the following is true:\n\n*   `perm[i]` is divisible by `i`.\n*   `i` is divisible by `perm[i]`.\n\nGiven an integer `n`, return _the **number** of the **beautiful arrangements** that you can construct_.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Define the base case for the recursion or dynamic programming, which is typically the smallest possible input size (in this case, `n = 1`).

The `treeToDoublyList` function takes the root of the binary search tree as input and returns the head of the sorted circular doubly-linked list.\n3.  In the `treeToDoublyList` function, we first perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree to get the sorted nodes in a list. We use a recursive helper function `inorder_traversal` to achieve this.\n4.  After the in-order traversal, we update the left and right pointers of each node in place by iterating through the list of nodes. We keep track of the predecessor and successor nodes to construct the sorted circular doubly-linked list.\n5.  Finally, we update the left and right pointers of the first and last nodes to complete the circular doubly-linked list.\n6."}

If it is, the function returns 0 because an empty tree has a maximum width of 0.\n- We initialize `max_width` to 0 to store the maximum width found so far and create a queue with the root node and its index (0) as the starting point.\n- We enter a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.\n- Inside the loop, we initialize `prev_nodes` to 0 and `curr_nodes` to the number of nodes in the current level (i.e., the length of the queue).\n- We then enter another while loop that processes all nodes at the current level.\n- Inside the inner loop, we remove the leftmost node from the queue, update `prev_nodes` to be the index of the removed node, and append its children to the queue if they exist.\n- We decrement `curr_nodes` to keep track of the remaining nodes at the current level.\n- Once all nodes at the current level have been processed, we update `max_width` by comparing it with the width of the current level, which is calculated as `prev_nodes - idx + 1`. This is because the width of a level is the difference between the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes, inclusive.\n- Finally, we return `max_width` as the maximum width of the binary tree."}

Store the updated bitwise OR in the `or_set` to ensure distinctness.\n\nHere's a Python solution that follows the given steps:\n\n```python\ndef subarrayBitwiseORs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an integer array `arr`, return the number of distinct bitwise ORs of all the non-empty subarrays of `arr`.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of distinct bitwise ORs of all the non-empty subarrays of `arr`.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    or_set = set()\n    or_set.add(0)  # Initialize the set with 0\n    max_or = 0\n\n    for right in range(n):\n        curr_or = 0\n        for left in range(right, -1, -1):\n            curr_or |= arr[right]\n            or_set.add(curr_or)\n            max_or = max(max_or, curr_or)\n\n    return len(or_set) - 1  # Subtract 1 because we added 0 initially\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 1, 2]\nprint(subarrayBitwiseORs(arr))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis solution initializes a set `or_set` to store the distinct bitwise ORs and a variable `max_or` to track the maximum bitwise OR encountered so far. It iterates over the array using a `right` pointer and for each position, it iterates over the subarray ending at the current position using a `left` pointer. The bitwise OR of the current window is calculated and stored in `or_set` to ensure distinctness. The maximum bitwise OR encountered is updated accordingly. Finally, the number of distinct bitwise ORs is returned by the size of `or_set` minus 1 (because we added 0 initially)."}

Therefore, the number of unique paths is equivalent to the number of ways to choose `m - 1` steps out of `m + n - 2` steps, which is given by the combination formula:\n\n`C(m + n - 2, m - 1) = (m + n - 2)! / (m - 1)! * (n - 1)!`\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef unique_paths(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of unique paths a robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of an m x n grid.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The number of rows in the grid.\n        n (int): The number of columns in the grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of unique paths the robot can take.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the total number of steps\n    total_steps = m + n - 2\n    \n    # Calculate the number of steps to the right\n    steps_to_right = n - 1\n    \n    # Use the combination formula to calculate the number of unique paths\n    unique_paths = math.comb(total_steps, steps_to_right)\n    \n    return unique_paths\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(unique_paths(3, 7))  # Output: 28\nprint(unique_paths(3, 2))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe provided code defines a function `unique_paths` that takes two integers `m` and `n` as input and returns the number of unique paths a robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid. The function uses the `math.comb` function from Python's math module to calculate the combination, which is equivalent to `C(m + n - 2, m - 1)`. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with different inputs and print the results."}

Reasoning: The problem statement asks for the smallest string that contains each string in `words` as a substring, and since we are given that no string in `words` is a substring of another string in `words`, we can assume that the optimal solution would be a concatenation of the strings in a specific order.

In this map, the key will be the start time and the value will be a list of end times for all events that start at the same time. This is because multiple events can start at the same time, so we need to store the end times for all of them.   This data structure will allow us to efficiently find the end times of all events that overlap with a given event.\nHere is the code based on the provided analysis:\n\n```python\nfrom sortedcontainers import SortedList\n\nclass MyCalendarThree:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.events = SortedList()\n\n    def book(self, start, end):\n        self.events.add((start, 1))\n        self.events.add((end, -1))\n\n        max_booking = 0\n        current_booking = 0\n        for _, delta in self.events:\n            current_booking += delta\n            max_booking = max(max_booking, current_booking)\n\n        self.events.remove((start, 1))\n        self.events.remove((end, -1))\n        return max_booking\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1.  The `MyCalendarThree` class is initialized with an empty `SortedList` called `events`. This data structure is used to store the events, where each event is represented as a tuple of `(start_time, delta)`. The `delta` value is either 1 for an event start or -1 for an event end.\n\n2.  In the `book` method, we first add the start and end times of the new event to the `events` list. We use the `add` method of `SortedList` to maintain the sorted order of the events by their start times.\n\n3.  We then iterate over the `events` list and update the `current_booking` value by adding the `delta` value of each event. We also update the `max_booking` value whenever we find a larger `current_booking`.\n\n4.  After the iteration, we remove the start and end times of the new event from the `events` list to restore the original state.\n\n5.  Finally, we return the maximum `k`-booking value found.\n\nNote: The `SortedList` class from the `sortedcontainers` library is used to efficiently store and retrieve events by their start times.

We then iterate over the rest of the elements in the `nums` array, updating `gcd` to be the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the current number using the `math.gcd` function.\n4.

It checks the base cases where the current node is null (representing a leaf node) or where the current node is one of the given nodes. Then, it recursively searches for the nodes in the left and right subtrees. If both nodes are found in different subtrees, the current node is the lowest common ancestor. If both nodes are found in the same subtree, the lowest common ancestor is in that subtree. If neither of the above conditions is met, it means the nodes are not in the tree."}

We will also store the index of the word in the dictionary in each node to keep track of the original word. To store the words in both forward and reverse order, we will store the word and its reverse in each node.

It then removes the nodes from the initial set that are part of the maximum connected component. Finally, it returns the node with the smallest index that, if removed, would minimize the number of nodes infected with malware.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where `graph[i][j] == 1` indicates a direct connection between nodes `i` and `j`.

We can use a Trie data structure to store the historical sentences. The Trie will have a nested structure, where each node represents a character in the sentence. We can store the frequency of each sentence at the end of the path. This way, we can efficiently retrieve all the sentences that have a certain prefix by traversing the Trie from the root to the node that corresponds to the last character of the prefix.  The Trie will have the following properties:  - Each node will have a dictionary to store the children nodes, where the keys are the characters and the values are the corresponding child nodes. - Each node will have a variable to store the frequency of the sentence that ends at this node. - Each node will have a variable to store the sentence that ends at this node.  We can use a hash map to store the Trie nodes, where the keys are the node identifiers and the values are the corresponding node objects.  The node identifier can be a tuple of the node's parent identifier and the character that leads to this node. This way, we can efficiently traverse the Trie from the root to a node that corresponds to a certain prefix.

If it is, add the node to the priority queue. 3.  Use the priority queue to retrieve the top 3 hot sentences. Since the priority queue is sorted based on the frequency of the sentences, the top 3 hot sentences will be the ones with the highest frequencies. 4.  If the priority queue has less than 3 nodes, return all the nodes in the priority queue. Otherwise, return the top 3 nodes in the priority queue.

{"question": "Analyze the problem and devise a solution plan. Once the plan is ready, implement it in Python and generate the code.\nSuppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n\n*   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.\n*   `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.\n\nNotice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return _the minimum element of this array_.\n\nYou must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[1,3,5\\]\n**Output:** 1\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** nums = \\[2,2,2,0,1\\]\n**Output:** 0\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `n == nums.length`\n*   `1 <= n <= 5000`\n*   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`\n*   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.\n\n**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?", "solution": "Step 1: Determine the approach to handle duplicates in the array while searching for the minimum element. One possible approach is to first find the unique elements in the array and then search for the minimum element among them. However, considering the constraints of the problem, this approach might not be the most efficient. Another approach could be to directly search for the minimum element in the array by comparing adjacent elements, as the array is sorted and rotated.\nStep 2: Move the `left` pointer to the right until it is equal to the `right` pointer. This is because we have found the range where the minimum element must exist. Now, we can use a binary search approach to find the minimum element within this range.\nHere's the Python code that implements the approach described in the problem analysis:\n\n```python\ndef findMin(nums):\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return nums[left]\n```\n\nIn this code, we use a binary search approach to find the minimum element in the rotated sorted array. The `left` and `right` pointers are used to represent the current search range. We move the `left` pointer to the right until it is equal to the `right` pointer, at which point we know that the minimum element is at the `left` index.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are using a binary search approach, which divides the search space in half with each iteration.\n\nThe space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not grow with the size of the input array. This is because we are only using a constant amount of space to store the `left` and `right` pointers.\n\nTo handle duplicates, this approach works as follows:\n\n*   When `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, it means that the minimum element must be in the right half of the array. Therefore, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n*   When `nums[mid] <= nums[right]`, it means that the minimum element must be in the left half of the array. Therefore, we move the `right` pointer to `mid`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we are always searching in the correct half of the array, which allows us to find the minimum element in O(log n) time even when the array contains duplicates."}
{"question": "Think deeply about the problem to identify the best approach. Formulate a well-reasoned plan, explaining each step of the process in detail before generating the Python code to execute your solution.\nHere's the question:\nThere is an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing the grid boundary). You can apply **at most** `maxMove` moves to the ball.\n\nGiven the five integers `m`, `n`, `maxMove`, `startRow`, `startColumn`, return the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Initialize the 3D array `dp` of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1) x (maxMove + 1)` with zeros, where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of paths to reach cell `(i, j)` at move `k`. The base cases are: (1) when the number of moves `k` is zero, the number of paths to reach any cell is zero, and (2) when the cell is out of the grid boundary, the number of paths to reach that cell is zero.\nStep 2: Implement a recursive function to fill up the `dp` array. For each cell `(i, j)` at move `k`, consider all four directions (up, down, left, right) and their corresponding valid cells `(i', j')` within the grid. If a valid cell is within the grid, calculate the number of paths to reach that cell at move `k - 1` and add it to the current number of paths to cell `(i, j)` at move `k`.\n\nHere's the code based on the provided steps:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findPaths(self, m: int, n: int, maxMove: int, startRow: int, startColumn: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        dp = [[[0] * (maxMove + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]\n\n        def fill_dp(i: int, j: int, k: int) -> int:\n            # Base cases\n            if i < 0 or i >= m or j < 0 or j >= n:\n                return 1\n            if k == 0:\n                return 0\n            if dp[i][j][k]!= 0:\n                return dp[i][j][k]\n\n            # Fill up the dp array\n            directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n            count = 0\n            for di, dj in directions:\n                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                count = (count + fill_dp(ni, nj, k - 1)) % MOD\n\n            dp[i][j][k] = count\n            return count\n\n        # Initialize the dp array\n        fill_dp(startRow, startColumn, maxMove)\n        return dp[startRow][startColumn][maxMove]\n```\n\nThis code implements the steps as described. It initializes a 3D array `dp` to store the number of paths to reach each cell at each move, and then fills up the array using a recursive function `fill_dp`. The base cases are handled first, and then the function considers all four directions and their corresponding valid cells within the grid to calculate the number of paths to reach each cell. The result is returned modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow."}

It first calculates the number of glasses in each row, then calculates the cumulative sum of champagne that has flowed into each glass. Finally, it returns the champagne level of the jth glass in the ith row.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the query row. This is because we need to iterate over each row and each glass in the row to calculate the cumulative sum of champagne that has flowed into each glass. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the number of glasses in each row and the cumulative sum of champagne for each glass."}

Otherwise, returns `-1`.\n*   `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if present, or inserts the `key` if not already present. When the cache reaches its `capacity`, it should invalidate and remove the **least frequently used** key before inserting a new item.

The key with the smallest **use counter** is the least frequently used key.\n\nWhen a key is first inserted into the cache, its **use counter** is set to `1` (due to the `put` operation).

{"question": "Break down the problem into smaller tasks and describe how each step should be solved. Then, provide the Python code that implements these steps.\nA frog is crossing a river.

The `dfs` function takes two parameters: the current stone position and the last jump distance. It checks all possible jumps from the current stone and recursively calls itself for the next stone if a valid jump is found. The result is stored in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations."}

The recurrence relation can be derived by considering the last song in the playlist. If the last song is a new song, we can add it to the playlist in j ways (since there are j different songs to choose from), so the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs is dp[i-1][j] * j.

However, we also need to consider the constraint that a song can only be played again if k other songs have been played, so we need to add an additional condition to the recurrence relation. If i <= k, then we can only add new songs to the playlist, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * j.

We can split the recurrence relation into two parts:  -   When the last song is a new song, we can add it to the playlist in j ways (since there are j different songs to choose from). This is represented by dp[i-1][j] * j. -   When the last song is a repeated song, we can add it to the playlist in (i - k) ways (since we need to have played k other songs before we can play it again).

We can define a table dp[i] to represent the number of arrays of length i with exactly k inverse pairs. However, directly computing dp[i] from dp[i-1] may be challenging due to the inverse pair constraint. Therefore, we need to find a way to relate dp[i] to smaller subproblems, such as arrays of length i-1 or i-2, that have fewer inverse pairs.

We initialize the table with zeros and set `dp[0]` to 1, as there is only one array of length 0 (the empty array).\n\nWe then iterate over the array length from 1 to `n`, and for each length `i`, we iterate over the possible last elements from 1 to `i`. For each last element, we calculate the number of inverse pairs it contributes to the total count and check if it is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, we update the `dp` table with the new value.\n\nFinally, we return the value of `dp[n]`, which represents the number of arrays of length `n` with exactly `k` inverse pairs.\n\nNote that we use the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensure that the result is within the range of 32-bit integers."}

{"question": "Analyze the problem and devise a solution plan. Once the plan is ready, implement it in Python and generate the code.\nYou have `n` super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.\n\nFor each move, you could choose any `m` (`1 <= m <= n`) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines at the same time.\n\nGiven an integer array `machines` representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, return _the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses_.

This step will involve finding the total sum of dresses by iterating through the array `machines` and summing up all the values. We will also find the median of the array, which will be the target number of dresses each machine should have. The median is the middle value in the sorted array, and it will be used to determine the minimum number of moves required to make all machines have the same number of dresses.\nStep 2: Otherwise, we will return `total_moves / 2` (since we are moving two dresses at a time), but we need to handle the case where the total sum of differences is zero, which means all machines already have the same number of dresses.\nHere's the Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\ndef findMinMoves(machines):\n    n = len(machines)\n    total_sum = sum(machines)\n    target = sum(machines) // n\n    if total_sum % n!= 0:\n        return -1\n    max_diff = 0\n    total_moves = 0\n\n    for num in machines:\n        max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(num - target))\n        total_moves += abs(num - target)\n\n    return total_moves // 2 if total_moves % 2 == 0 else -1\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.  We first calculate the total sum of dresses in all washing machines by summing up all the values in the `machines` array.\n2.  We then calculate the median of the array by dividing the total sum by the number of machines (`n`). We use integer division (`//`) to get the integer part of the result.\n3.  If the total sum of differences between the target and the current number of dresses in each machine is not zero, it means all machines already have the same number of dresses, so we return -1.\n4.  We then iterate through the `machines` array and calculate the maximum difference between the target and the current number of dresses in each machine. We also calculate the total moves by adding up the absolute differences between the target and the current number of dresses in each machine.\n5.  Finally, we return the total moves divided by 2 if the total moves is even; otherwise, we return -1.\n\nHere's how you can use this function with the example inputs:\n\n```python\nprint(findMinMoves([1, 0, 5]))  # Output: 3\nprint(findMinMoves([0, 3, 0]))  # Output: 2\nprint(findMinMoves([0, 2, 0]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nThis code should work for all valid inputs and return the minimum number of moves required to make all machines have the same number of dresses."}

This step involves moving the end of the window to the right by incrementing the end index, adding the next element from the array to the sum of the window, and calculating the average of the current window.

We then calculate the average of this initial window and store it in `max_average`.\n*   We then enter a loop that starts from the `k-th` index of the array and goes up to the end of the array. In each iteration of the loop, we update the `window_sum` by subtracting the element that just left the window (at index `i - k`) and adding the new element that just entered the window (at index `i`). We then update `max_average` to be the maximum of its current value and the average of the current window.\n*   We continue this process until the end of the array is reached.\n*   Finally, we return `max_average`, which stores the maximum average of all subarrays of length `k` or more.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables."}

This path can be either increasing or decreasing.\n\n*   For example, `[1,2,3,4]` and `[4,3,2,1]` are both considered valid, but the path `[1,2,4,3]` is not valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Identify the base cases for the recursive function, which include handling the case when the current node is None, and the case when the current node has no children.\nStep 2: Initialize a variable `longest_path` to keep track of the longest consecutive path found so far, and define a recursive helper function that takes the current node and the current path length as parameters to explore the tree depth-first and identify consecutive paths.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestConsecutive(self, root):\n        self.longest_path = 0\n        \n        def dfs(node, current_path):\n            if not node:\n                return 0\n            \n            # Handle the case when the current node has no children\n            left_path = dfs(node.left, current_path)\n            right_path = dfs(node.right, current_path)\n            \n            # If the current node is the start of a new sequence, update the longest path\n            if not current_path or node.val - current_path[-1] == 1 or node.val - current_path[-1] == -1:\n                current_path.append(node.val)\n                self.longest_path = max(self.longest_path, len(current_path))\n                return max(len(current_path), left_path, right_path)\n            else:\n                # Reset the current path if it's not a consecutive sequence\n                current_path = [node.val]\n                return max(len(current_path), left_path, right_path)\n        \n        dfs(root, [])\n        return self.longest_path\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe provided code implements a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree and find the longest consecutive path. The `longestConsecutive` function initializes the `longest_path` variable to keep track of the longest consecutive path found so far and defines the `dfs` helper function.\n\nThe `dfs` function takes the current node and the current path as parameters. It first checks for the base cases: if the current node is None, it returns 0. If the current node has no children, it recursively calls `dfs` on the left and right children and returns the maximum of the current path length, the left path length, and the right path length.\n\nIf the current node is the start of a new sequence, it updates the longest path and appends the current node's value to the current path. Otherwise, it resets the current path to contain only the current node's value.\n\nFinally, the `longestConsecutive` function calls the `dfs` function on the root node and returns the longest path found.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```python\n# Create a binary tree\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(5"}

It then splits the input string into a list of nodes by using the comma as a delimiter. The code then iterates over each node in the list, pushing the node's value onto the stack if it's not a null node, and popping the top of the stack twice if it's a null node. Finally, the code checks if the stack has one node left and it's not a null node, and returns True if the serialization is valid, False otherwise."}

Then, it generates all combinations of `n` soldiers taken `r` at a time using the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module. For each combination, it checks if the rating condition is satisfied and increments a counter if it is. The final answer is the total number of valid teams.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of soldiers, because it generates all combinations of `n` soldiers taken `r` at a time, and for each combination, it checks the rating condition. However, this is the most straightforward solution to the problem, and the time complexity is acceptable for small to medium-sized inputs."}

This ensures that the running product is always accurate and up-to-date.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `ProductOfNumbers` class based on the provided analysis:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass ProductOfNumbers:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the object with an empty stream.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.deque = deque()\n        self.product = 1\n\n    def add(self, num: int) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Appends the integer `num` to the stream.\n        \n        Args:\n        num (int): The integer to be appended to the stream.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Remove elements from the front of the deque if it exceeds the capacity of k integers\n        while len(self.deque) > 0 and self.deque[0] == 0:\n            self.deque.popleft()\n        \n        # Append the new integer to the end of the deque\n        self.deque.append(num)\n        \n        # Update the running product\n        if num == 0:\n            self.product = 1\n            self.deque.clear()\n        else:\n            self.product *= num\n\n    def getProduct(self, k: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current list.\n        \n        Args:\n        k (int): The number of integers to calculate the product of.\n        \n        Returns:\n        int: The product of the last `k` numbers in the current list.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if k is greater than the current length of the deque\n        if k > len(self.deque):\n            raise ValueError(\"k cannot be greater than the current length of the deque\")\n        \n        # Return the product of the last k integers in the deque\n        return self.product\n```\n\nHere's an example usage of the `ProductOfNumbers` class:\n\n```python\n# Create an instance of the ProductOfNumbers class\nproduct_of_numbers = ProductOfNumbers()\n\n# Add integers to the stream\nproduct_of_numbers.add(3)\nproduct_of_numbers.add(0)\nproduct_of_numbers.add(2)\nproduct_of_numbers.add(5)\nproduct_of_numbers.add(4)\n\n# Calculate the product of the last k integers\nprint(product_of_numbers.getProduct(2))  # Output: 20\nprint(product_of_numbers.getProduct(3))  # Output: 40\nprint(product_of_numbers.getProduct(4))  # Output: 80\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `ProductOfNumbers` class and add integers to the stream using the `add`"}

This can be achieved by using two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end of the window, respectively.

The `right` pointer is moved to the right to expand the window, and the `left` pointer is moved to the right when the number of distinct characters exceeds `k`.

The graph will have at least one edge for each ticket, and it will help us to find the possible paths for the itinerary.\nStep 2: Implement a topological sorting algorithm to explore the graph and find the valid paths. We will use a recursive function to traverse the graph and find all possible paths starting from the departure airport \"JFK\". The topological sorting algorithm will allow us to order the nodes in a way that for every edge (u,v), node u comes before v in the ordering. This will ensure that we visit the nodes in a valid order, and we can easily compare the lexical order of the paths.\nHere is the Python solution based on the problem analysis:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef findItinerary(tickets):\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for departure, arrival in sorted(tickets)[::-1]:\n        graph[departure].append(arrival)\n        \n    def dfs(airport, path):\n        if len(path) == len(tickets) + 1:\n            return path\n        if airport not in graph:\n            return None\n        for _ in range(len(graph[airport])):\n            next_airport = graph[airport].pop()\n            result = dfs(next_airport, path + [next_airport])\n            if result is not None:\n                return result\n            graph[airport].append(next_airport)\n        return None\n        \n    return dfs(\"JFK\", [\"JFK\"])\n\n# Test cases\ntickets = [[\"MUC\", \"LHR\"], [\"JFK\", \"MUC\"], [\"SFO\", \"SJC\"], [\"LHR\", \"SFO\"]]\nprint(findItinerary(tickets))  # Output: [\"JFK\", \"MUC\", \"LHR\", \"SFO\", \"SJC\"]\n\ntickets = [[\"JFK\", \"SFO\"], [\"JFK\", \"ATL\"], [\"SFO\", \"ATL\"], [\"ATL\", \"JFK\"], [\"ATL\", \"SFO\"]]\nprint(findItinerary(tickets))  # Output: [\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"SFO\", \"ATL\", \"SFO\"]\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create a graph where each key is an airport and its corresponding value is a list of arrival airports. We then use a recursive function `dfs` to perform a depth-first search on the graph, starting from the departure airport \"JFK\". The `dfs` function returns the first valid path it finds, which is the one with the smallest lexical order.\n\nWe use the `sorted` function with the `[::-1]` slice to sort the tickets in reverse order before adding them to the graph.

Then, it uses a depth-first search (DFS) function to form the `target` string. The DFS function tries each character from each string in `words` and recursively calls itself with the updated `used` table and the next character in the `target` string. The base case for the DFS function is when the entire `target` string is formed, in which case it returns 1. The final result is returned modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow."}

The keys of the dictionary are the frequencies and the values are the counts of words with that frequency.\n\nFinally, for each query, the function counts the number of words with a smaller frequency of the lexicographically smallest character than the query string by iterating over the keys of the `word_freq` dictionary and adding up the counts of words with a smaller frequency. The results are stored in the `answer` array, which is returned at the end."}

{"question": "Break down the problem into smaller tasks and describe how each step should be solved. Then, provide the Python code that implements these steps.\nA **[binary expression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree)** is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).\n\nFor each internal node with operator `o`, the [**infix expression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.\n\nYou are given a string `s`, an **infix expression** containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.\n\nReturn _any valid **binary expression tree**, whose **[in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR))** reproduces_ `s` _after omitting the parenthesis from it._\n\n**Please note that order of operations applies in** `s`**.** That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.\n\nOperands must also appear in the **same order** in both `s` and the in-order traversal of the tree.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Design the recursive function signature to parse the infix expression and construct the binary expression tree. The function should take the string `s` and return the root node of the binary expression tree.\nHere's the step-by-step implementation of the binary expression tree construction from an infix expression:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef buildTree(s: str) -> TreeNode:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a binary expression tree from a given infix expression.\n    \n    Args:\n    s (str): The infix expression as a string.\n    \n    Returns:\n    TreeNode: The root node of the constructed binary expression tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    def helper(s):\n        # Base case: If the string is empty, return None\n        if not s:\n            return None\n        \n        # Find the first operand or operator\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():\n            i += 1\n        operand = int(s[:i])\n        \n        # If the character at the current index is an operator\n        if s[i] in '+-*/':\n            # Recursively build the left and right subtrees\n            left = helper(s[i+1:])\n            right = helper(s[i+1 + s[i+1:].find(')') + 1:])\n            return TreeNode(s[i], left, right)\n        else:\n            # If the character at the current index is not an operator, it's the first operand\n            return TreeNode(operand)\n\n    return helper(s)\n```\n\nThis recursive function `buildTree` takes the infix expression `s` as input and constructs the binary expression tree. The helper function `helper` is used to recursively build the tree. The function first checks for the base case where the input string is empty. Then it finds the first operand or operator in the string. If it's an operator, it recursively builds the left and right subtrees and creates a new internal node with the operator and the roots of the left and right subtrees. If it's the first operand, it creates a leaf node with the operand value."}

The `uniqueSet` stores unique integers, `addedSet` stores integers that have been added to the queue but not yet marked as unique, and the `queue` stores the input integers.\n-   The `showFirstUnique` method checks the queue from front to back. If it finds an integer that exists in the `uniqueSet` but not in the `addedSet`, it returns that integer. If no such integer is found, it returns -1.\n-   The `add` method adds an integer to the queue and updates the `uniqueSet` and `addedSet` accordingly.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Create an instance of FirstUnique\nfirst_unique = FirstUnique([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 3, 2"}

The outer loop iterates over the number of sticks `i`, the middle loop iterates over the number of visible sticks `j`, and the inner loop iterates over the possible positions of the `j`-th visible stick. The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, which represents the number of arrangements of 0 sticks with 0 visible sticks. The final result is stored in `dp[n][k]`.\n\nNote that we use the modulo operation to prevent the result from exceeding the maximum limit of `int`."}

Here is the optimized code:\n\n```python\ndef firstMissingPositive(nums):\n    # Step 1: Sort the input array nums in ascending order\n    nums.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize a variable to store the smallest missing positive integer\n    smallest_missing_positive = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted array\n    for num in nums:\n        # If the current number is greater than 1 and equal to the smallest missing positive integer, increment the smallest missing positive integer\n        if num > 1 and num == smallest_missing_positive:\n            smallest_missing_positive += 1\n    \n    # Return the smallest missing positive integer\n    return smallest_missing_positive\n\n# Example usage\nprint(firstMissingPositive([1, 2, 0]))  # Output: 3\nprint(firstMissingPositive([3, 4, -1, 1]))  # Output: 2\nprint(firstMissingPositive([7, 8, 9, 11, 12]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis optimized solution still runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting operation, but it uses constant extra"}

This function should take an array of cities as input and return a set of unique substrings. The function can be implemented using a sliding window approach, where the window size starts from 1 and increases up to the length of the path. For each window size, we generate all substrings of that size and add them to the set of unique substrings. We also need to handle the case where the same substring appears multiple times in the path, but is only added to the set once.\nHere is the Python code for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonSubpath(n, paths):\n    def get_unique_substrings(path):\n        unique_substrings = set()\n        for window_size in range(1, len(path) + 1):\n            for i in range(len(path) - window_size + 1):\n                substring = tuple(path[i:i + window_size])\n                unique_substrings.add(substring)\n        return unique_substrings\n\n    def check_common_substring(substring):\n        for path in paths:\n            if substring not in set(tuple(path[i:i + len(substring)]) for i in range(len(path) - len(substring) + 1)):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    max_length = 0\n    for path in paths:\n        unique_substrings = get_unique_substrings(path)\n        for substring in unique_substrings:\n            if check_common_substring(substring):\n                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))\n\n    return max_length\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n- The `get_unique_substrings` function generates all unique substrings for a given path. It uses a sliding window approach to generate substrings of different sizes and adds them to a set to avoid duplicates. The set is used because it automatically removes duplicates.\n\n- The `check_common_substring` function checks if a given substring is common to all paths. It converts each path into a set of substrings and checks if the given substring is in any of the sets.\n\n- The main function iterates over each path and generates its unique substrings. It then checks each substring to see if it is common to all paths. If it is, it updates the maximum length of the common subpath.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*m^2), where n is the number of cities and m is the maximum length of a path. This is because for each path, we generate all unique substrings (O(m^2)), and then check each substring against all other paths (O(n*m))."}

We'll also consider the base case where the current index is equal to the length of the string, in which case we'll evaluate the final expression and check if it equals the target value.\nStep 2: Before recursively calling the function for the next index, we should also consider the case where the current index is not at the beginning of the string and the current character is '0'. In this case, we should check if the character before the current character is not a '+' or '-' operator, indicating that we are not at the start of a new operand. If this condition is met, we can safely proceed with the recursion, but we should also consider removing the leading '0' from the current expression before doing so.

{"question": "Thoroughly analyze the given problem to understand its requirements. Break it down into logical steps, and propose a detailed approach for solving it.

Each row of blocks contains **one less block** than the row beneath it and is centered on top.\n\nTo make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific **triangular patterns** that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a **single block** stacked on top of **two blocks**.

Note that this is different from `\"BAC \"` where `'B'` is on the left bottom and `'A'` is on the right bottom.\n\nYou start with a bottom row of blocks `bottom`, given as a single string, that you **must** use as the base of the pyramid.\n\nGiven `bottom` and `allowed`, return `true` _if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that **every triangular pattern** in the pyramid is in_ `allowed`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.\n\n", "solution": "Step 1: Define a function `can_build_pyramid(bottom, allowed)` that takes in the `bottom` row and the list of `allowed` patterns, and returns a boolean indicating whether the pyramid can be built successfully.

The function decides which subtree to add the current node to based on its value compared to the target.\n\n- If the current node is `None`, it returns `None` for both the left and right subtrees.\n- If the current node's value is less than the target, it recursively calls `splitTree` on the right child of the current node and sets the right child of the current node to the left subtree.\n- If the current node's value is greater than the target, it recursively calls `splitTree` on the left child of the current node and sets the left child of the current node to the right subtree.\n- If the current node's value is equal to the target, it recursively calls `splitTree` on the left and right children of the current node and returns the roots of the left and right subtrees.\n\nThe `splitBST` function calls the `splitTree` function with the root node, the target, and `False` as the initial split status, and returns the roots of the two subtrees.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Create a sample binary tree:\n#       4\n#      / \\\n#     2   6\n#    / \\   \\\n#   1   3   5\nroot = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(6)\nroot.left.left ="}

{"question": "For the given problem, generate a step-by-step plan for solving it, followed by the corresponding Python code.\nThere are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where **exactly one** of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have `minutesToTest` minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.\n\nYou can feed the pigs according to these steps:\n\n1.  Choose some live pigs to feed.\n2.  For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.\n3.  Wait for `minutesToDie` minutes. You may **not** feed any other pigs during this time.\n4.  After `minutesToDie` minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.\n5.  Repeat this process until you run out of time.\n\nGiven `buckets`, `minutesToDie`, and `minutesToTest`, return _the **minimum** number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time_.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:\nAt time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.\nAt time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:\n- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.\n- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.\n- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.\n- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30\n**Output:** 2\n**Explanation:** We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:\nAt time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.\nAt time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:\n- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.\n- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.\nAt time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= buckets <= 1000`\n*   `1 <= minutesToDie <= minutesToTest <= 100`", "solution": "Step 1: We need to calculate the range of possible values for the minimum number of pigs. Let's define the minimum possible number of pigs as `low` and the maximum possible number of pigs as `high`. Since we can feed the pigs in parallel and each pig can feed from any number of buckets, we can start by setting `low` to 1 and `high` to `buckets`. This is because we can potentially use all `buckets` as the minimum number of pigs if we feed each pig from all buckets simultaneously.\nStep 2: We need to determine how to utilize the time constraint `minutesToTest` to narrow down the range of possible values for the minimum number of pigs. Since we have `minutesToDie` minutes to determine whether a pig has been fed the poisonous bucket, we can use this information to calculate the maximum number of pigs that can be fed within the remaining time `minutesToTest - minutesToDie`. This will help us to determine the maximum number of pigs that can be used to feed the buckets in parallel, and therefore, narrow down the range of possible values for the minimum number of pigs.\nHere is the complete code based on the provided problem and the step-by-step analysis:\n\n```python\ndef poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest):\n    low, high = 1, buckets\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        time_needed = (1 << mid) * minutesToDie\n        if time_needed <= minutesToTest:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return low\n```\n\nExplanation of the code:\n\n1.  We start by initializing `low` to 1 and `high` to `buckets`. This represents the range of possible values for the minimum number of pigs.\n2.  We then enter a while loop that continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.\n3.  Inside the loop, we calculate the middle value `mid` using the formula `(low + high + 1) // 2`. This is a common technique to find the middle value of two numbers.\n4.  We then calculate the time needed to test `mid` pigs, which is `(1 << mid) * minutesToDie`. The expression `1 << mid` is equivalent to `2 ** mid`, which represents the number of possible outcomes after `mid` pigs have been tested. We multiply this by `minutesToDie` to get the total time needed to test `mid` pigs.\n5.  If the time needed to test `mid` pigs is less than or equal to `minutesToTest`, we update `low` to `mid`. This means that we can potentially use `mid` pigs to determine which bucket is poisonous within the given time constraint.\n6.  If the time needed to test `mid` pigs is greater than `minutesToTest`, we update `high` to `mid - 1`. This means that we cannot use `mid` pigs to determine which bucket is poisonous within the given time constraint, so we need to consider a smaller number of pigs.\n7.  We repeat steps 3-6 until `low` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low` represents the minimum number of pigs needed to determine which bucket is poisonous within the given time constraint.\n8.  Finally, we return `low` as the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(log(buckets)) because we use a binary search approach to find the minimum number of pigs. The space"}

We need to find the maximum number of operations needed to delete the entire string `s`.

The `t_freq` dictionary will store the frequency of each character in string `t`, and the `window_freq` dictionary will store the frequency of each character in the current window.\nStep 2: Expand the window to the right by one character, and update the window_freq dictionary.   This step is necessary because we need to move the window to the right until we have covered all the characters in string t. By expanding the window to the right, we can increase the count of characters in the window_freq dictionary and check if the current window satisfies the condition of including all characters from string t.   In this step, we should update the window_freq dictionary by incrementing the count of the new character that has been added to the window, and check if the counts of characters in the window_freq dictionary match the counts in the t_freq dictionary.

It keeps track of the characters in the window using the `window_freq` dictionary and checks if the counts of characters in the window match the counts in the `t_freq` dictionary. If they match, it updates the minimum window and continues to shrink the window until it cannot be shrunk further.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t respectively. This is because each character in both strings is visited once. The space complexity is also O(m + n) due to the use of the `window_freq` and `t_freq` dictionaries."}
