We will define a recursive function `numDistinct` that takes two parameters: the current index `i` in string `s` and the current index `j` in string `t`. This function will calculate the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the current indices `i` and `j`.  We will also define a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `(len(s) + 1) x (len(t) + 1)` to store the intermediate results. The table `dp[i][j]` will store the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the current indices `i` and `j`.  The base cases for the recursion will be when `j` is equal to the length of string `t` (i.e., we have processed all characters in `t`), in which case we will return 1 (since there is only one way to form an empty string), or when `i` is greater than the length of string `s` (i.e., we have processed all characters in `s`), in which case we will return 0 (since there are no more characters to form the subsequence).  The recursive case will consider two possibilities: either we include the current character in `s` at index `i` in the subsequence, or we do not include it. If we include the current character, we will check if it matches the current character in `t` at index `j`. If it matches, we will add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences. If it does not match, we will simply add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences. If we do not include the current character, we will simply add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j` to the current number of distinct subsequences.  The final answer will be stored in the cell `dp[len(s)][len(t)]` of the dynamic programming table.\nStep 2: Now we need to modify the recursive function to handle the case when the current character in `s` does not match the current character in `t` but the subsequence can still be formed by excluding the current character in `s`. We will add a condition to check if the current character in `t` is the same as the previous character in `t`, and if so, we will exclude the current character in `s` and add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j`. This can be done by adding a new condition to the recursive case: if `j > 0` and `t[j] == t[j - 1]`, we will add the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t` up to the previous indices `i - 1` and `j - 1` to the current number of distinct subsequences.\n"}

One possible approach is to first find the unique elements in the array and then search for the minimum element among them.

{"question": "The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in **the bottom-right corner** of a `dungeon`. The `dungeon` consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in **the top-left room** and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.\n\nThe knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.\n\nSome of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).\n\nTo reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only **rightward** or **downward** in each step.\n\nReturn _the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess_.\n\n**Note** that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** dungeon = \\[\\[-2,-3,3\\],\\[-5,-10,1\\],\\[10,30,-5\\]\\]\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** dungeon = \\[\\[0\\]\\]\n**Output:** 1\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == dungeon.length`\n*   `n == dungeon[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`\n*   `-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000`", "solution": "Step 1: We need to handle the case when the knight's health drops to `0` or below. We can do this by setting `dp[i][j]` to `inf` (infinity) if the knight's health drops to `0` or below when moving from the room above or to the left. This is because it's not possible to reach the room at `(i, j)` if the knight's health drops to `0` or below.   For example, if `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` is less than or equal to `0`, we can set `dp[i][j]` to `inf`. This will ensure that we don't try to move to a room with a health of `0` or below, which would cause the knight's health to drop to `0` or below.\nStep 2: We need to calculate the minimum initial health required to reach each room in the first row and column. Since the knight can only move rightward or downward, the minimum initial health required to reach each room in the first row is the maximum of the health required to reach the previous room and the health in the current room. This can be calculated using the following logic: For the first row, we can calculate `dp[0][j]` as `max(dp[0][j-1], -dungeon[0][j])`, which means the minimum initial health required to reach the current room is the maximum of the minimum initial health required to reach the previous room and the negative health in the current room. This is because the knight can either move from the previous room to the current room or stay in the current room, and the minimum initial health required to reach the current room is the maximum of these two possibilities. Similarly, for the first column, we can calculate `dp[i][0]` as `max(dp[i-1][0], -dungeon[i][0])`. This logic can be applied to the first row and column of the dp table to initialize the values.\n"}

In the base case where there is only one balloon, the maximum coins that can be collected is the number on that balloon multiplied by 1, since there is no other balloon to burst.   Let's denote the array of balloon numbers as `nums` and the number of balloons as `n`. We can define the base case as follows:  - If `n == 1`, the maximum coins that can be collected is `nums[0] * 1`.  However, since we need to consider the coins that can be collected when there is no balloon left (i.e., when there is one balloon and we burst it), we also need to consider the case where `n == 0` or `n == -1` (to account for the balloons on the left and right of the first balloon).  - If `n == 0` or `n == -1`, the maximum coins that can be collected is 0, since there are no balloons to burst.  The base cases are essential to establish a recursive formula to calculate the maximum coins for a given number of balloons.

However, since we need to consider the optimal order of bursting the balloons, we should also consider the case where `j - i > 1`. In this case, we can burst the balloon at index `k` (where `i <= k < j`) and get the coins `nums[i] * nums[k] * nums[j]`.

{"question": "There are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where **exactly one** of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have `minutesToTest` minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.\n\nYou can feed the pigs according to these steps:\n\n1.  Choose some live pigs to feed.\n2.  For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.\n3.  Wait for `minutesToDie` minutes. You may **not** feed any other pigs during this time.\n4.

This is because we can potentially use all `buckets` as the minimum number of pigs if we feed each pig from all buckets simultaneously.\nStep 2: We need to determine how to utilize the time constraint `minutesToTest` to narrow down the range of possible values for the minimum number of pigs.

Each turn is `90` degrees.\n\nWhen the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it stays on the current cell.\n\nDesign an algorithm to clean the entire room using the following APIs:\n\ninterface Robot {\n  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.\n  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.\n  boolean move();\n\n  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.\n  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.\n  void turnLeft();\n  void turnRight();\n\n  // Clean the current cell.\n  void clean();\n}\n\n**Note** that the initial direction of the robot will be facing up. You can assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by a wall.\n\n**Custom testing:**\n\nThe input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must solve this problem \"blindfolded \". In other words, you must control the robot using only the four mentioned APIs without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** room = \\[\\[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1\\],\\[1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\\],\\[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0\\],\\[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\\]\\], row = 1, col = 3\n**Output:** Robot cleaned all rooms.\n**Explanation:** All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.\n0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.\nThe robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.\nFrom the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** room = \\[\\[1\\]\\], row = 0, col = 0\n**Output:** Robot cleaned all rooms.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `m == room.length`\n*   `n == room[i].length`\n*   `1 <= m <= 100`\n*   `1 <= n <= 200`\n*   `room[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.\n*   `0 <= row < m`\n*   `0 <= col < n`\n*   `room[row][col] == 1`\n*   All the empty cells can be visited from the starting position.", "solution": "Step 1: Move the robot down until it hits a wall or reaches the bottom edge of the room.

This information will be crucial for navigating the robot to the right edge of the room in the next step.\n"}
{"question": "There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`).

This function should take the ring string, the character to rotate to, and the current character as input, and return the minimum distance between the two characters when rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise. The function can be implemented using string manipulation and modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ring.\nStep 2: Implement a function to calculate the distance between the current character and the target character for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations.  This function can be achieved by extending the existing function to consider both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations. We can use the same string manipulation and modular arithmetic techniques to calculate the distances for both rotations.  For example, if we have a ring string \"godding\" and we want to rotate it to align the character \"d\" with the current character \"g\", we can calculate the distance for both clockwise and anticlockwise rotations using the following formulas:  - Clockwise rotation: `distance_clockwise = (ring.index(target_char) - ring.index(current_char)) % ring.length` - Anticlockwise rotation: `distance_anticlockwise = (ring.index(current_char) - ring.index(target_char)) % ring.length`  We can then use these distances to determine the minimum number of steps required to spell each character in the key.

We can use a variable named `secret_word` to hold the secret word, and we can also initialize an empty list to store the possible guesses.   We can start by sorting the list of words based on their similarity to the secret word. We can use a custom sorting function that calculates the similarity between two words based on the number of matching characters.\nStep 2: Implement a function to calculate the similarity between two words based on the number of matching characters. This function can be used to sort the list of words in descending order of similarity to the secret word.   The function can iterate over the characters of the two words and compare them. For each pair of characters, if they match, it increments a counter. The function then returns the counter as the similarity score. This score represents the number of matching characters between the two words.  For example, if we have two words \"acckzz\" and \"acckzz\", the similarity score would be 6, because all characters match. If we have two words \"acckzz\" and \"ccbazz\", the similarity score would be 3, because three characters match.   This function can be used to sort the list of words in descending order of similarity to the secret word, so that the most similar words are considered first.\n"}

We need to define the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs, denoted as dp[i][j]. The base cases are when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there is only one way to create a playlist (i.e., an empty playlist), so dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 for all i and j.  The recurrence relation can be derived by considering the last song in the playlist. If the last song is a new song, we can add it to the playlist in j ways (since there are j different songs to choose from), so the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs is dp[i-1][j] * j. If the last song is a repeated song, we can add it to the playlist in (i - k) ways (since we need to have played k other songs before we can play it again), so the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs is dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - k).  However, we also need to consider the constraint that a song can only be played again if k other songs have been played, so we need to add an additional condition to the recurrence relation. If i <= k, then we can only add new songs to the playlist, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * j. If i > k, then we can add both new songs and repeated songs to the playlist, so dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] * j + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - k)) % (10^9 + 7).\nStep 2: Simplify the recurrence relation by considering the two cases separately: when the last song is a new song and when the last song is a repeated song. We can split the recurrence relation into two parts:  -   When the last song is a new song, we can add it to the playlist in j ways (since there are j different songs to choose from). This is represented by dp[i-1][j] * j. -   When the last song is a repeated song, we can add it to the playlist in (i - k) ways (since we need to have played k other songs before we can play it again). This is represented by dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - k).  However, we also need to consider the constraint that a song can only be played again if k other songs have been played. If i <= k, then we can only add new songs to the playlist, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * j. If i > k, then we can add both new songs and repeated songs to the playlist, so dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] * j + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - k)) % (10^9 + 7).  But we should also consider that the last song in the playlist can be either new or repeated. If the last song is new, then the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs is dp[i-1][j] * j. If the last song is repeated, then the number of ways to create a playlist of length i using at most j different songs is dp[i-1][j-1] * (i - k).\n"}
